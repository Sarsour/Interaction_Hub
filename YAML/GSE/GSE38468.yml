  Overall-Design: 'We carried out Hi-C experiment using HindIII on Kc167 cells and
    generate two libraries separately. One library was sequenced once more as technical
    replicates (TR1 and TR2), the other library was sequenced as biological replicate
    (BR).

    processed files contain the following:

    Column 1:  chromosome ID in which the first read in a pair locates

    Column 2:  coordinate of the first read

    Column 3:  chromosome ID in which the second read in a pair locates

    Column 4:  coordinate of the second read'

  Summary: The mechanisms responsible for the establishment of physical domains in
    metazoan chromosomes are poorly understood. Here we find that physical domains
    in Drosophila chromosomes are demarcated at regions of active transcription and
    high gene density that are enriched for transcription factors and specific combinations
    of insulator proteins. Physical domains contain different types of chromatin defined
    by the presence of specific proteins and epigenetic marks, with active chromatin
    preferentially located at the borders and silenced chromatin in the interior.
    Domain boundaries participate in long-range interactions that may contribute to
    the clustering of regions of active or silenced chromatin in the nucleus. Analysis
    of transgenes suggests that chromatin is more accessible and permissive to transcription
    at the borders than inside domains, independent of the presence of active or silencing
    histone modifications. These results suggest that the higher-order physical organization
    of chromatin may impose an additional level of regulation over classical epigenetic
    marks.
