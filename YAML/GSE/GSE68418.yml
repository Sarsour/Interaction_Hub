  Overall-Design: Hi-C experiments were performed on wild type and mutant cells of
    Bacillus subtilis PY79 growing in rich or poor media. ChIP-seq experiments were
    performed on two strains of Bacillus subtilis PY79 growing in the same condition
    as in Hi-C experiments.

  Summary: SMC condensin complexes play a central role in compacting and resolving
    replicated chromosomes in virtually all organisms yet how they accomplish this
    remains elusive. In Bacillus subtilis, condensin is loaded at centromeric parS
    sites, where it encircles DNA and individualizes newly replicated origins. Using
    chromosome conformation capture and cytological assays, we show that condensin
    recruitment to origin-proximal parS sites is required for the juxtaposition of
    the two chromosome arms. Recruitment to ectopic parS sites promotes alignment
    of large tracks of DNA flanking these sites. Importantly, insertion of parS sites
    on opposing arms indicates that these ?zip-up? interactions only occur between
    adjacent DNA segments. Collectively, our data suggest that condensin resolves
    replicated origins by promoting the juxtaposition of DNA flanking parS sites drawing
    sister origins in on themselves and away from each other. These results are consistent
    with a model in which condensin encircles the DNA flanking its loading site and
    then slides down, tethering the two arms together. Lengthwise condensation via
    loop-extrusion could provide a generalizable mechanism by which condensin acts
    dynamically to individualize origins in B. subtilis and, when loaded along eukaryotic
    chromosomes, to resolve them during mitosis.
