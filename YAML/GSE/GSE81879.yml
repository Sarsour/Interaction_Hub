  Overall-Design: 'Performed Hi-C on two human lymphoblastoid cell lines with known
    chromosomal translocations (FY1199 and DD1618) and on a transformed mouse cell
    line (EKLF). In addition, performed Hi-C on six human brain tumours: five glioblastomas
    ( GB176, GB180, GB182, GB183 and GB238) and one anaplastic astrocytoma (AA86).
    Hi-C was also performed in a human cell line control (GM07017).  QDNAseq was performed
    on the AA86, GB176, GB180, GB182, GB183 and GB238 sampes.'

  Summary: Chromosomal rearrangements are prevalent events in the human population,
    occurring both constitutionally in the general population and somatically in the
    majority of cancers. Detection of balanced rearrangements, such as reciprocal
    translocations and inversions, is troublesome with many rearrangements remaining
    undetected. This is particularly detrimental in oncology where rearrangements
    play diagnostic and prognostic roles and can influence choice and efficacy of
    treatment protocols. New methods to detect and characterize balanced rearrangements
    are therefore required for both research and clinical applications. Here we describe
    the use of the chromosome conformation capture derived method Hi-C as a tool for
    detection of both balanced and unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements in cell lines
    and human tumor samples, with the ability to detect gene fusions and define chromosomal
    breakpoints to base pair resolution. In addition, we show that copy number information
    can also be obtained from the same data, allowing rearrangements, gains, amplifications
    and deletions of genomic regions to be detected in a single experiment.
