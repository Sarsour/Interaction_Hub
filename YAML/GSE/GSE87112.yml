  Overall-Design: 'The study contains new Hi-C datasets in 11 primary adult tissues.
    4 of the 11 tissues have biological replicates, which is defined as two datasets
    from the same tissue type but from different donor individuals.The study also
    contains analysis of 3 previously published tissue Hi-C datasets (Leung et al.,
    2015), as well as several other cell lines from other studies as noted throughout
    our study. The study also contains the re-analysis and integration of previously
    published RNA-seq by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium (GEO database under accession
    number GSE16256 and from SRA database under accession umber SRP000941).

    all the Hi-C data generated in this study can be visualized in 3dgenome.org'

  Summary: The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes
    in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited.
    Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of
    chromatin organization in cultured cells, however, genome architecture in human
    tissues has yet to be explored.  Here, we report the most comprehensive survey
    to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis
    of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we discover
    genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions.
    These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for active enhancers
    and are located near tissue-specifically expressed genes. Unlike previously identified
    chromatin loops, FIREs tend to engage in promiscuous local chromatin interactions
    in a tissue-specific manner. FIRE formation is dependent on the Cohesin complex.
    Additionally, we show that FIREs can help annotate function of non-coding sequence
    variants.
