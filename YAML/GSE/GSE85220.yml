  Overall-Design: Chromatin is fragmented by Mnase, subsequenct nucleosomal end repair,
    and a modified two-step method for purfiying ligation products. Using Illumina
    paired-end sequencing maps Micro-C library and generates nucleosome resolution
    contact maps.

  Summary: Structural analysis of chromosome folding in vivo has been revolutionized
    by Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) and related methods, which use proximity
    ligation to identify chromosomal loci in physical contact. We recently described
    a variant 3C technique, Micro-C, in which chromatin is fragmented to mononucleosomes
    using micrococcal nuclease, enabling nucleosome-resolution folding maps of the
    genome. Here, we describe an improved Micro-C protocol using long crosslinkers,
    termed Micro-C XL, which exhibits greatly increased signal to noise, and provides
    further insight into the folding of the yeast genome. We also find that signal
    to noise is much improved in Micro-C XL libraries generated from relatively insoluble
    chromatin as opposed to soluble material, providing a simple method to physically
    enrich for bona-fide long-range interactions. Micro-C XL maps of the budding and
    fission yeast genomes reveal both short-range chromosome fiber features such as
    chromosomally-interacting domains (CIDs), as well as higher-order features such
    as clustering of centromeres and telomeres, thereby addressing the primary discrepancy
    between prior Micro-C data and reported 3C and Hi-C analyses. Interestingly, comparison
    of chromosome folding maps of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe revealed widespread qualitative
    similarities, yet quantitative differences, between these distantly-related species.
    Micro-C XL thus provides a single assay suitable for interrogation of chromosome
    folding at length scales from the nucleosome to the full genome.
