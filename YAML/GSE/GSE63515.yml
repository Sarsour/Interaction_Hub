  Overall-Design: Analysis of 3D chromatin organization using Hi-C in Drosophila Kc167
    cells. Cells were grown at 25 C and heat shocked for 20 min at 36.5 C. Cells were
    also treated with flavopiridol or triptolide to inhibit transcription elongation
    or initiation, respectively. Cells were depeleted of Cap-H2 or Rad21 using RNAi.
    Finally, cells depleted of RAd21 were subjected to heat shock at 36.5 C for 20
    min.

  Summary: Chromosomes of metazoan organisms are partitioned in the interphase nucleus
    into discrete topologically associating domains (TADs). Borders between TADs are
    preferentially formed in regions containing high density of active genes and clusters
    of architectural protein binding sites. Transcription of most genes is turned
    off during the heat shock response in Drosophila. Here we show that temperature
    stress induces relocalization of architectural proteins from TAD borders to inside
    TADs, and this is accompanied by a dramatic rearrangement in the 3D organization
    of the nucleus. TAD border strength declines, allowing for an increase in long-distance
    inter-TAD interactions. Similar but quantitatively weaker effects are observed
    upon inhibition of transcription or depletion of individual architectural proteins.
    New heat shock-induced inter-TAD interactions result in increased contacts among
    enhancers and promoters of silenced genes, which recruit Pc and form Pc bodies
    at the nucleolus. These results suggest that the TAD organization of metazoan
    genomes is plastic and can be quickly reconfigured to allow new interactions between
    distant sequences.
