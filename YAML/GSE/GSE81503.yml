  Overall-Design: 'Three human CHi-C biological replicates were generated (comprising
    1, 2and 3 technical replicates). Two mouse CHi-C biological replicates were generated
    (both comprising three technical replicates) and a mouse Hi-C dataset. The publicly
    available HiCUP pipeline (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.7334.1) was used to process
    the raw sequencing reads. This pipeline was used to map the read pairs against
    the mouse (mm9) and human (hg19) genomes, to filter experimental artefacts (such
    as circularized reads and re-ligations), and to remove duplicate reads. For the
    CHi-C data, the resulting BAM files were processed into CHiCAGO input files, retaining
    only those read pairs that mapped, at least on one end, to a captured bait. CHiCAGO
    then identified Hi-C restriction fragments interacting, with statistical significant,
    to captured baits.'

  Summary: Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) is a state-of-the art method for profiling chromosomal
    interactions involving targeted regions of interest (such as gene promoters) globally
    and at high resolution. Signal detection in CHi-C data involves a number of statistical
    challenges that are not observed when using other Hi-C-like techniques. We present
    a background model, and algorithms for normalisation and multiple testing that
    are specifically adapted to CHi-C experiments, in which many spatially dispersed
    regions are captured, such as in Promoter CHi-C. We implement these procedures
    in CHiCAGO (http://regulatorygenomicsgroup.org/chicago), an open-source package
    for robust interaction detection in CHi-C. We validate CHiCAGO by showing that
    promoter-interacting regions detected with this method are enriched for regulatory
    features and disease-associated SNPs.
