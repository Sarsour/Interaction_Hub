  Overall-Design: We performed Hi-C and promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) to investigate
    the dynamics of the 3D chromatin structure during adipocyte differentiation. We
    used mRNA-seq to identify changes in gene expression and ChIP-seq to map the chromatin
    binding of transcriptional regulators and epigenomic marks.

  Summary: Interactions between transcriptional promoters and their distal regulatory
    elements play an important role in transcriptional regulation; however, the extent
    to which these interactions are subject to rapid modulations in response to signals
    is unknown. Here, we use promoter capture Hi-C to demonstrate a rapid reorganization
    of promoter anchored  chromatin loops within four hours after induction of differentiation
    of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This reorganization is tightly coupled to dynamic changes
    in target gene expression. The formation of promoter-enhancer loops is tightly
    linked to the activation of poised (histone H3 lysine 4 mono- and dimethylated)
    enhancers, as evidenced by the acquisition of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation
    and the binding of MED1, SMC1 and P300 proteins to these regions. Intriguingly,
    formation of loops connecting activated enhancers and promoters is also associated
    with extensive recruitment of corepressors such as NCoR and HDACs, indicating
    that this class of coregulators may play a previously unrecognized role during
    enhancer activation.
