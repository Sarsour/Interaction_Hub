  Overall-Design: "Caulobacter cells were depleted of DnaA for 1.5 h before synchronization.\
    \ Swarmer cells were then released into DnaA depleting conditions (without IPTG)\
    \ and double-strand breaks were induced for 1 h by the addition of 500 \u03BC\
    M vanillate. For control sample, no vanillate was added. Formadehyde (Sigma) was\
    \ then added to the final concentration of 1%. Formadehyde crosslinks protein-DNA\
    \ and DNA-DNA together, thereby capturing the structure of the chromosome at the\
    \ time of fixation. Fixation was performed at the cell density of OD600 = 0.2.\
    \ The crosslinking reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at 25 \xB0\
    C before quenching with 2.5 M glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 M. Fixed\
    \ cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and subsequently washed twice with\
    \ 1x M2 buffer (6.1 mM Na2HPO4, 3.9 mM KH2PO4, 9.3 mM NH4Cl, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 10\
    \ \u03BCM FeSO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2) before resuspending in 1x TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl\
    \ pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA) to a final concentration of 107 cells per \xB5l. Resuspended\
    \ cells were then divided into 25 \xB5l aliquots and stored at -80 \xB0C for no\
    \ more than 2 weeks. Each Hi-C experiment was performed using two of the 25 \xB5\
    L aliquots. Chromosome conformation capture with next-generation seqeuncing (Hi-C)\
    \ was carried out exactly as described previously (Le et al., 2013 PMID: 24158908)"

  Summary: Double-strand breaks (DSBs) can lead to the loss of genetic information
    and cell death. Consequently, cells in all domains of life have evolved mechanisms
    to repair DSBs, including through homologous recombination. Although recombination
    has been well characterized, the spatial organization of this process in living
    cells remains poorly understood. Here, we introduced site-specific DSBs in Caulobacter
    crescentus, and then used time-lapse microscopy to visualize the homology search,
    DSB repair, and the resegregation of chromosomal DNA. Even loci tethered to opposite
    cell poles can efficiently release, pair to enable recombination-based repair,
    and then resegregate to their original locations. Resegregation occurs independent
    of DNA replication and without disrupting global chromosome organization. Origin-proximal
    regions are resegregated by the same machinery, ParABS, used to segregate undamaged
    chromosomes following DNA replication. In contrast, origin-distal regions efficiently
    resegregate after a DSB independent of ParABS, and likely without dedicated segregation
    proteins. Instead, we propose that a physical, spring-like force drives the resegregation
    of origin-distal loci after DSB repair.
