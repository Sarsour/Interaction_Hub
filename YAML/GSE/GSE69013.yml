  Summary: Recent advances enabled by Hi-C technique have unraveled principles of
    chromosomal folding, which were since linked to many genomic processes. In particular,
    Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into Topologically Associating
    Domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence
    gene expression. However, mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome
    into TADs remain poorly understood. To explore principals of TAD folding in Drosophila
    melanogaster, we performed Hi-C and PolyA+ RNA-seq in four cell lines of various
    origins (S2, Kc167, DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find
    that regions between TADs (i.e. the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila
    are only weakly enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator
    protein Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs
    harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes. Accordingly,
    we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw) predict TAD boundaries
    much worse than the active chromatin marks (in the minimal case, H3K4me3 and total
    RNA) do. Moreover, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted interbands of polytene
    chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands. Collectively,
    our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active
    chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin that cannot be organized
    into compact structures, possibly due to high levels of histone acetylation. Finally,
    we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations, and find that TAD partitioning
    can be explained by different modes of inter-nucleosomal interactions for active
    and inactive chromatin.
