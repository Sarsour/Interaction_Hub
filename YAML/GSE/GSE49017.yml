  Summary: To ensure proper gene regulation within constrained nuclear space, chromosomes
    facilitate access to transcribed regions, while compactly packaging all other
    information. Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale
    domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization
    is important for genome function. Here we show that very specific long-range interactions
    are anchored by cohesin/CTCF sites, but not cohesin-only or CTCF-only sites, to
    form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. These loops demarcate topological domains
    and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient
    for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss
    of cohesin/CTCF contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional
    analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization
    leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes.
    Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain
    structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programs
    within them.
