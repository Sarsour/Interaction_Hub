  Summary: "The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome within the cell\
    \ nucleus contributes to cell-specific gene expression in different cell types1.\
    \ High-throughput 3C\u2013derived methods have revealed that the genome is segmented\
    \ into contiguous topologically associating domains (TADs), which help to orchestrate\
    \ gene expression changes during differentiation and development2-5. Using ChIP-Seq,\
    \ Hi-C and 3D modelling techniques, we reveal that TADs regulate the rapid gene\
    \ expression changes induced by progestin in T47D breast cancer cells. In response\
    \ to the hormone, TADs maintain their borders and operate as discrete regulatory\
    \ units in which the majority of the genes are either transcriptionally activated\
    \ or repressed. Additionally, the epigenetic signatures of the TADs are coordinately\
    \ modified by hormone in correlation with the transcriptional changes. Hormone-induced\
    \ changes in gene activity and chromatin remodelling are accompanied by structural\
    \ changes that are distinct for activated or repressed TADs. Integrative 3D modelling\
    \ revealed that TADs are structurally expanded if active and compacted if repressed,\
    \ and that this is accompanied by differential changes in accessibility. We thus\
    \ propose that TADs function as \u201Cregulons\u201D to enable spatially proximal\
    \ genes to be coordinately transcribed in response to hormones."
