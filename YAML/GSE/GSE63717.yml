  Overall-Design: Our goal was to determine the molecular topology of the dosage compensated
    X chromosomes of C. elegans.  To do so we performed Hi-C analysis and FISH analysis
    in wild-type XX embryos and mutant XX embryos in which the dosage compensation
    complex was defective and could therefore not bind to the X chromosome.   We showed
    the dosage compensation complex actively shapes the topology of the entire X chromosome
    and creates a unique, sex-specific Xconformation that differs from the conformation
    of autosomes. RNA-seq experiments in wild-type and mutant embryos permitted a
    comparison between changes in chromosome structure and changes in gene expression.

  Summary: The three-dimensional (3D) organization of a genome plays a critical role
    in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms
    that determine higher-order chromosome structure or how structure influences gene
    expression. Here we exploit the X-chromosome-wide process of dosage compensation
    to dissect these mechanisms. The dosage compensation complex (DCC) of C. elegans,
    a condensin complex, binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites via sequence-specific
    recruitment sites (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half.
    Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and single-cell FISH to compare
    chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos (DC mutants), we show
    that the DCC remodels X chromosomes of hermaphrodites into a spatial conformation
    distinct from autosomes. The dosage-compensated X chromosomes are composed of
    Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that have sharper boundaries and more
    regular spacing than TADs on autosomes. Most TAD boundaries on X coincide with
    the highest-affinity rex sites, and these boundaries are lost or diminished in
    DC mutants, thereby restoring the topology of X to a native conformation resembling
    that of autosomes. Although most rex sites engage in multiple strong DCC-dependent
    long-range interactions, the strongest interactions occur between rex sites at
    the DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. We propose the DCC actively shapes the topology
    of the entire X chromosome by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing pre-existing
    weak TAD boundaries through interactions between its highest affinity sites. Such
    changes in higher-order X-chromosome structure then influence gene expression
    over long distances.
