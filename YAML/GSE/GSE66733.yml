  Summary: 'Background:

    Higher-order chromatin structure is often perturbed in cancer and other pathological
    states. Although several genetic and epigenetic differences have been charted
    between normal and breast cancer tissues, changes in higher-order chromatin organization
    during tumorigenesis have not been fully explored. To probe the differences in
    higher-order chromatin structure between mammary epithelial and breast cancer
    cells, we performed Hi-C analysis on MCF-10A mammary epithelial and MCF-7 breast
    cancer cell lines.


    Results:

    Our studies reveal that the small, gene-rich chromosomes chr16 through chr22 in
    the MCF-7 breast cancer genome display decreased interaction frequency with each
    other compared to the inter-chromosomal interaction frequency in the MCF-10A epithelial
    cells. Interestingly, this finding is associated with a higher occurrence of open
    compartments on chr16-22 in MCF-7 cells. Pathway analysis of the MCF-7 up-regulated
    genes located in altered compartment regions on chr16-22 reveals pathways related
    to repression of WNT signalling. There are also differences in intra-chromosomal
    interactions between the cell lines; telomeric and sub-telomeric regions in the
    MCF-10A cells display more frequent interactions than are observed in the MCF-7
    cells.


    Conclusions:

    We show evidence of an intricate relationship between chromosomal organization
    and gene expression between epithelial and breast cancer cells. Importantly, this
    work provides a genome-wide view of higher-order chromatin dynamics and a resource
    for studying higher-order chromatin interactions in two cell lines commonly used
    to study the progression of breast cancer.'
