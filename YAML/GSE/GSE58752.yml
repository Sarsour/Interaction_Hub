  Summary: Allelic differences between the two sets of chromosomes can affect the
    propensity of inheritance in humans, but the extent of such differences in the
    human genome has yet to be fully explored.  Here, we delineate allelic chromatin
    modifications and transcriptomes amongst a broad set of human tissues, enabled
    by a chromosome-span haplotype reconstruction strategy1. The resulting haplotype-resolved
    epigenomic maps reveal extensive allele bias in the transcription of human genes
    as well as chromatin state, allowing us to infer cis-regulatory relationships
    between genes and their control sequences. These maps also uncover a new class
    of cis regulatory elements and detail activities of repetitive elements in various
    human tissues. The rich datasets described here will enhance our understanding
    of the mechanisms controlling tissue-specific gene expression programs.
