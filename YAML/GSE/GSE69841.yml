  Summary: Mammalian interphase chromosomes interact with the nuclear lamina (NL)
    through hundreds of large Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). We report a method
    to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of ~400 maps reveals
    a core architecture of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell
    consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable
    contacts are more sensitive to a change in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts.
    Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over
    hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination
    of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential
    interactions as detected by Hi-C. Finally, single-cell gene expression and chromatin
    accessibility analysis shows that loci with consistent NL contacts are expressed
    at lower levels and are more consistently inaccessible than loci with lower contact
    frequencies. These results highlight fundamental principles of single cell chromatin
    organization.
