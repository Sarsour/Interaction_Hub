  Overall-Design: Analysis of the spatial organization of the P. falciparum genome
    at three stages of the erythrocytic cycle using chromosome conformation capture
    coupled with next generation sequencing (Hi-C). As a control, we included one
    sample for which chromatin contacts were not preserved by crosslinking of DNA
    and proteins.

  Summary: The development of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is
    controlled by coordinated changes in gene expression throughout its complex life
    cycle, but the corresponding regulatory mechanisms are incompletely understood.
    To study the relation between genome architecture and gene regulation in Plasmodium,
    we studied the genome structure of P. falciparum at three time points during its
    erythrocytic (asexual) cycle. Using chromosome conformation capture coupled with
    next-generation sequencing technology (Hi-C), we obtained high-resolution chromosomal
    contact maps, which we then used to construct a consensus three-dimensional genome
    structure for each time point. We observe strong clustering of centromeres, telomeres,
    ribosomal DNA and virulence genes, resulting in a complex architecture that cannot
    be explained by a simple volume exclusion model. Internal virulence gene clusters
    appear to be an important factor in shaping the genome architecture as they exhibit
    domain-like structures similar to topological domains in mammalian genomes. Midway
    during the cell cycle, at the highly transcriptionally active trophozoite stage,
    the genome adopts a more open chromatin structure with increased chromosomal intermingling.
    In addition, we observed reduced expression of genes located in spatial proximity
    to the repressive subtelomeric center, and colocalization of distinct groups of
    parasite-specific genes with coordinated expression profiles. Overall, our results
    are indicative of a strong association between the P. falciparum spatial genome
    organization and gene expression. Understanding the molecular processes involved
    in genome conformation dynamics could contribute to the discovery of novel antimalarial
    strategies.
