  Summary: "Eukaryotic genomes are folded into a hierarchy of three-dimensional structures\
    \ that impact nuclear functions, including transcription, replication, and repair1-3.\
    \ Studies in Drosophila and mammals have revealed megabase-sized topologically\
    \ associated domains (TADs) within chromosomes, which in turn are spatially restricted\
    \ within the nucleus4-8.  However, little is known about local physical constraints\
    \ that drive higher-order folding of chromosomes. Here we performed Hi-C analysis\
    \ of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to explore genome organization\
    \ at high resolution. S. pombe comprises a small genome ideal for examining structural\
    \ features of chromatin folding, and contains fundamental components present in\
    \ higher eukaryotes. Large domains of heterochromatin coat centromeres and telomeres\
    \ and recruit cohesin, a ring-like protein complex that binds sister chromatids\
    \ and mediates long range looping of interphase chromosomes. Our analyses reveal\
    \ a highly ordered chromosome organization, consistent with a Rabl configuration,\
    \ which is dependent on constraints imposed at centromeres and telomeres. We find\
    \ that local chromatin compaction and cohesin recruitment to centromeres mediated\
    \ by heterochromatin is required for maintaining global genome territorial restraint.\
    \ In addition to larger complex domains, we also observed locally interacting\
    \ regions of chromatin ~50 kilobases long, which organize chromosome arms into\
    \ structures referred to as \u201Cglobules\u201D. Globule boundaries are enriched\
    \ in cohesin and convergent gene orientation. The role of cohesin in maintaining\
    \ globule domains is independent of its role in sister chromatid cohesion, as\
    \ globule domains are also a feature of G1 chromosome architecture. Defect in\
    \ cohesin disrupts globule domains and results in an altered chromosome organization\
    \ at larger scales, including the loss of chromosome territories. Disruption of\
    \ globules also affects functional annotation of the genome, leading to impairment\
    \ of borders between neighboring transcriptional units. Our analyses reveal key\
    \ features of chromatin organization and folding and show that distinct mechanisms\
    \ uniquely impact the hierarchy of genome organization to protect genome integrity\
    \ and to coordinate nuclear functions."
