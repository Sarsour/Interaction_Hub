  Summary: We have investigated boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs)
    in the Drosophila genome and find that they can be identified as domains of very
    low H3K27me3. The genome-wide H3K27me3 profile partitions into two states; very
    low H3K27me3 identifies Depleted (D) domains that contain housekeeping genes and
    their regulators such as the histone acetyltransferase-containing NSL complex,
    whereas domains containing mid-to-high levels of H3K27me3 (Enriched or E domains)
    are associated with regulated genes, irrespective of whether they are active or
    inactive. The D domains correlate with the boundaries of TADs and are enriched
    in a subset of architectural proteins, particularly Chromator, BEAF-32, and Z4.
    However, rather than being clustered at the borders of these domains, these proteins
    bind throughout the H3K27me3-depleted regions and are much more strongly associated
    with the TSSs of the housekeeping genes than with the H3K27me3 domain boundaries.
    We suggest that the D domain chromatin state, characterised by very low H3K27me3
    and established by housekeeping gene regulators, acts to separate topological
    domains thereby setting up the domain architecture of the genome.
