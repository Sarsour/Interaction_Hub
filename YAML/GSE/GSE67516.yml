  Summary: The inactive X chromosome (Xi) serves as a model to understand gene silencing
    on a global scale. Here, we perform identification of direct RNA interacting proteins?
    (iDRiP) to isolate a comprehensive protein interactome for Xist, an RNA required
    for Xi silencing. We discover multiple classes of interactors, including cohesins,
    condensins, topoisomerases, RNA helicases, chromatin remodelers and modifiers,
    which synergistically repress Xi transcription. Inhibiting two or three interactors
    destabilizes silencing. While Xist attracts some interactors, it repels architectural
    factors. Xist evicts cohesins from the Xi and directs an Xi-specific chromosome
    conformation. Upon deleting Xist, the Xi acquires the cohesin-binding and chromosomal
    architecture of the active X. Our study unveils many layers of Xi repression and
    demonstrates a central role for RNA in the topological organization of mammalian
    chromosomes. The RNA-seq data sets generated in this study provide a resource
    for examining the effects of knockdowns of various Xist-interacting proteins on
    gene expression. The ChIP-seq data sets provide a comprehensive set of data examining
    CTCF and cohesion binding the X-chromosome, and the effects of deleting Xist on
    CTCF and cohesion binding. The Hi-C data is an allele-specific contact map of
    the X-chromosome higher-order chromatin structure in mouse.
