  Summary: HiCUP is a pipeline for processing sequence data generated by Hi-C, a technique
    used to investigate the three-dimensional organisation of a genome. The pipeline
    maps data to a specified reference genome and removes artefacts that would otherwise
    hinder subsequent analysis. HiCUP also provides an easy-to-interpret yet detailed
    quality control report that may be used by researchers to refine their experimental
    protocol for future studies. The software is freely available and has already
    been used for processing Hi-C data in several recently published peer-reviewed
    research articles.    This experiment investigates the impact of using HiCUP to
    remove putative PCR amplification products in heavily duplicated Capture Hi-C
    libraries.
