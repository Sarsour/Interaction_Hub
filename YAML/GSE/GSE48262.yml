  Summary: Large-scale chromosome structure and spatial nuclear arrangement have been
    linked to control of gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Genomic techniques
    based on chromosome conformation capture assess contacts for millions of loci
    simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from millions
    of nuclei. Here we introduce single cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide statistical
    analysis and structural modeling of single copy X chromosomes, to show that individual
    chromosomes maintain domain organisation at the megabase scale, but show variable
    cell-to-cell chromosome territory structures at larger scales. Despite this structural
    stochasticity, localisation of active gene domains to boundaries of territories
    is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation, affecting most domains in most nuclei.
    Single cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies
    of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organisation underlies dynamic chromosome
    structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity
    patterns.
