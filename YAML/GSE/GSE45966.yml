  Overall-Design: Hi-C experiments were performed on untreated wild type swarmer cells
    and drug-treated swarmer cells (Novobiocin or Rifampicin) of Caulobacter crescentus
    CB15N. Hi-C were also performed on swarmer cells of smc knock-out and hup1hup2
    knock-out mutants of Caulobacter crescentus. Time-course Hi-C were performed on
    a synchronous population of Caulobacter crescentus at 5, 10, 30, 45, 60 and 75
    minutes after synchronization.  The progression of DNA replication during the
    cell cycle was followed by total genomic DNA sequencing.

  Summary: Chromosomes must be highly compacted and organized within cells, but how
    this is achieved in vivo remains poorly understood. We report the first use of
    Hi-C to map the structure of bacterial chromosomes at a high, unprecedented resolution.
    Analysis of Hi-C data and polymer modeling indicates that the Caulobacter crescentus
    chromosome consists of multiple, largely independent spatial domains likely comprised
    of supercoiled plectonemes arrayed into a bottlebrush-like fiber. These domains
    are stable throughout the cell cycle and re-established concomitantly with DNA
    replication. We provide strong evidence that domain boundaries are established
    by highly-expressed genes and the formation of plectoneme-free regions. Additionally,
    we use Hi-C to demonstrate that supercoiling, the histone-like protein HU, and
    SMC act at different length-scales and in complementary ways to organize and structure
    chromosomes within cells.
