  Overall-Design: 'Capture Hi-C was carried out to characterise the interactions of
    confirmed susceptibility loci for four autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis
    (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and juvenile idiopathic
    arthritis (JIA) with the aim of linking associated variants with disease-causing
    genes. We have tested the interactions in two complementary experiments: the first,
    Region Capture, targets regions associated with disease; the second, Promoter
    Capture, provides independent validation through capturing all known promoters
    within 500kb of lead associated disease SNPs. All experiments were performed in
    human T-cell (Jurkat) and B-cell (GM12878) lines in duplicate.'

  Summary: Genome-wide association studies have been tremendously successful in identifying
    genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The majority of association
    signals are intergenic and evidence is accumulating that a high proportion of
    signals lie in enhancer regions.We use Capture Hi-C to investigate, for the first
    time, the interactions between associated variants for four autoimmune diseases
    and their functional targets in B- and T-cell lines. Here we report numerous looping
    interactions and provide evidence that only a minority of interactions are common
    to both B- and T-cell lines, suggesting interactions may be highly cell-type specific;
    some disease-associated SNPs do not interact with the nearest gene but with more
    compelling candidate genes (for example, FOXO1, AZI2) often situated several megabases
    away; and finally, regions associated with different autoimmune diseases interact
    with each other and the same promoter suggesting common autoimmune gene targets
    (for example, PTPRC, DEXI and ZFP36L1).
