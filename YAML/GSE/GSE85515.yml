  Summary: "Our experiments aimed to investigate the landscape of enhancers and super-enhancers\
    \ in na\xEFve, effector and memory CD8+ T cells. Here we mapped four histone modification\
    \ marks and gene expression in naive, effector, and memory cells after viral infection.\
    \ Our results suggest that the chromatin environment at regulatory DNA sequences\
    \ in TCM is more permissive than in TN and TE. We further predicted the enhancers\
    \ and their targets, and constructed transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs)\
    \ in three T cell stages. We have identified a highly dynamic repertoire of the\
    \ enhancers and their targets during CD8 T cell responses, as 77% of the enhancers\
    \ and 82% of the enhancer-promoter interactions are stage-specific. Our results\
    \ suggest the dynamic change of enhancer activity during cell stage transition\
    \ leads to TRN rewiring, which explains the expression change of the key factors\
    \ of T cell function."
