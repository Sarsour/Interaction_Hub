  Summary: A subset of genomic regions, including one of the female X chromosomes
    and all imprinted genes, are expressed exclusively from a single allele in somatic
    cells of mammals. To evaluate structural changes associated with allelic silencing,
    we used mouse F1 hybrid systems in which X inactivation is skewed and alleles
    can be distinguished based on single nucleotide polymorphisms to analyze chromatin
    contacts by a new Hi-C assay that uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation. Both
    DNase Hi-C and in situ DNase Hi-C reveal a radically different conformation between
    the two female mouse X chromosomes. Two superdomains of frequent intrachromosomal
    contacts separated by a hinge region are specifically observed on the inactive
    X chromosome both in vivo (brain) and in vitro (Patski cells). A bipartite 3D
    organization of the inactive X has been also reported in human lymphoblastoid
    cells, suggesting that this conserved structure probably plays an important role
    in maintenance of gene silencing on the inactive X. Interestingly, we found that
    the genomic content of the superdomains differs between species, but that part
    of the hinge region is conserved and located near the Dxz4/DXZ4 locus that binds
    CTCF on the inactive X. In mouse, the hinge region also contains a minisatellite
    Ds-TR adjacent to a promoter with strong CTCF binding. Both Dxz4 and Ds-TR bind
    nucleophosmin and are enriched in nucleolus-associated chromatin, suggesting anchoring
    to the nucleolus. Genes that escape X inactivation do not cluster but are preferentially
    located near the periphery of the 3D structure. Regions enriched in CTCF or RNA
    polymerase are also preferentially located on the periphery of the inactive X
    while LINE1 elements are preferentially on the interior. Genes subject to silencing
    exhibit fewer detectable intrachromosomal contacts than escape genes. This transcription-coupled
    pattern is also evident for imprinted genes, in which more chromatin contacts
    are detected on the expressed allele, suggesting greater constraint on the organization
    of expressed genomic regions.
