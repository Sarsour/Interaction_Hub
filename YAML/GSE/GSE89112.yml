  Summary: "The locations of chromatin loops in Drosophila were determined by Hi-C\
    \ (chemical cross-linking, restriction digestion, ligation, and high-throughput\
    \ DNA sequencing).  Whereas most loop boundaries or \u201Canchors\u201D are associated\
    \ with CTFC protein in mammals, loop anchors in Drosophila were found most often\
    \ in association with the polycomb group (PcG) protein Polycomb (Pc), a subunit\
    \ of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1).  Loops were frequently located within\
    \ domains of PcG-repressed chromatin.  Promoters located at PRC1 loop anchors\
    \ regulate some of the most important developmental genes and are less likely\
    \ to be expressed than those not at PRC1 loop anchors.  Although DNA looping has\
    \ most commonly been associated with enhancer-promoter communication, our results\
    \ indicate that loops are also associated with gene repression."
