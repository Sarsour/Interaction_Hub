  Summary: The 3D organization of the genome is important for regulation of diverse
    nuclear processes ranging from transcription to DNA replication. Knowledge of
    the higher order chromatin structure is critical for understanding mechanisms
    of gene regulation by long-range control elements such as enhancers and insulators.
    We describe high resolution, genome-wide dynamic chromatin interaction maps in
    human embryonic stem cells (hESC) as they differentiate into four distinct embryonic
    cell lineages. Extensive reorganization of higher-order chromatin structure occurs
    during hESC differentiation. In this process, topological domains remain largely
    intact but inter-domain association patterns change dramatically, coincident with
    widespread changes in chromatin state and gene expression. Moreover, using proximity
    ligation sequencing to generate chromosome span haplotypes, widespread allele
    biased gene activities are detected. The allelic gene expression patterns can
    be correlated to epigenetic state at distal enhancers, supporting the role of
    these elements in regulating gene expression over a distance.
