  Summary: Chromosomes are the physical realization of genetic information and thus
    form the basis for its reading, hindering and propagation. Here we present a high-resolution
    chromosomal contact map derived from a new genome-wide chromosome conformation
    capture approach (a simplified version of the Hi-C method) applied to Drosophila
    embryonic nuclei. The data show that the entire genome is linearly partitioned
    into well-demarcated physical domains that overlap extensively with active and
    repressive epigenetic marks. Chromosomal contacts are hierarchically organized
    between domains. Global modeling of compaction and clustering of domains show
    that inactive domains are condensed and confined to their chromosomal territories,
    while active domains reach out of the territory to form remote intra- and inter-chromosomal
    contacts.
