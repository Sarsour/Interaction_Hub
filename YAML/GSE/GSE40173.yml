  Summary: The genome is folded into domains that are located in either transcriptionally
    inert or permissive compartments.  Here we used genome-wide strategies to characterize
    domains during B cell development. Structured Interaction Matrix Analysis revealed
    that CTCF occupancy was primarily associated with intra-domain interactions, whereas
    p300, E2A, Pax5 and PU.1 were involved with intra- and inter-domain interactions
    that are developmentally regulated.  We identified a spectrum of genes that switched
    nuclear location during early B cell development. In progenitors the transcriptionally
    inactive Ebf1 locus was sequestered at the nuclear lamina, thereby preserving
    multipotency, however upon development into the pro-B cell stage Ebf1 and other
    genes switched compartments to establish de novo intra- and inter-domain interactions
    that were associated with B lineage specific transcription signatures.
