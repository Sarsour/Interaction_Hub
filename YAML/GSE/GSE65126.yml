  Summary: "Topological domains are key architectural building blocks of chromosomes\
    \ in complex genomes. Their functional importance and evolutionary dynamics are\
    \ however not well defined.  Here we performed comparative Hi-C in liver cells\
    \ from four mammalian species, and characterized the conservation and divergence\
    \ of chromosomal contact insulation and the resulting domain architectures within\
    \ distantly related genomes. We show that the modular organization of chromosomes\
    \ is robustly conserved in syntenic regions. This overall conservation is compatible\
    \ with conservation of the binding landscape of the insulator protein CTCF.  Specifically,\
    \ conserved CTCF sites are co-localized with cohesin, enriched at strong topological\
    \ domain borders and bind to DNA motifs with orientations that define the directionality\
    \ of CTCF\u2019s long-range interactions. Interestingly, CTCF binding sites which\
    \ are divergent between species are strongly correlated with divergence of internal\
    \ domain structure. This divergence is likely driven by local CTCF binding sequence\
    \ changes, demonstrating how genome evolution can be linked directly with a continuous\
    \ flux of local chromosome conformation changes. Conversely, we provide evidence\
    \ that large-scale domains are harder to break and that they are reorganized during\
    \ genome evolution as intact modules."
