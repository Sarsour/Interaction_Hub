  Summary: The folding of genomic DNA from the beads-on-a-string like structure of
    nucleosomes into higher order assemblies is thought to be critically linked to
    nuclear processes, but it is unclear to what degree it is a cause or consequence
    of function. We have calculated the first 3D structural models of entire mammalian
    genomes using data from a new chromosome conformation capture protocol that allows
    us to first image and then process single cells. This has allowed us to study
    the folding of chromosomes down to a sub-100 kb scale. We show that the structures
    of individual topological-associated domains, chromosomes, and the way they pack
    together, varies very substantially from cell-to-cell. However, in all cells we
    find a consistent large-scale organization of compartments, with active enhancers
    and promoters clustering near inter-chromosomal interfaces, suggesting that nuclear
    processes such as transcription may drive chromosome and genome folding.
