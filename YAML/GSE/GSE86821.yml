  Overall-Design: Two human ESC CHi-C biological replicates were generated (comprising
    1 and 2 technical replicates) and a human ESC Hi-C dataset. Two human NEC CHi-C
    biological replicates were generated and a human NEC Hi-C dataset.   Two RNA-Seq
    biological replicates for both human ESC and NEC were generated.

  Summary: "Lineage commitment is characterised by orchestrated changes in gene expression\
    \ and chromatin state. Long-range elements such as enhancers coordinate lineage-specific\
    \ transcriptional programmes by engaging in DNA looping interactions with target\
    \ promoters. However, the target genes of most long-range elements remain unknown,\
    \ hindering an integrated understanding of cis-regulatory gene control. Here,\
    \ we generate a high-resolution atlas of chromosomal interactions involving ~22,000\
    \ gene promoters in human pluripotent and lineage-committed cells, identifying\
    \ putative target genes for known and predicted enhancer elements. We jointly\
    \ consider promoters and their associated interacting regions as \u201Ccis-regulatory\
    \ units\u201D that potentially integrate and stabilise regulatory inputs from\
    \ individual elements. We reveal extensive dynamics of cis-regulatory units upon\
    \ lineage commitment, including the acquisition and loss of promoter interactions,\
    \ as well as chromatin state changes at preformed interactions. Finally, we show\
    \ that reconfiguration of cis-regulatory units associates with changes in target\
    \ gene expression. Our results therefore provide a high-resolution view of promoter\
    \ interactome dynamics during lineage commitment and provide insights into the\
    \ mechanisms of developmental transcriptional regulation."
