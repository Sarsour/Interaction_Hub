  Summary: Transcription and processing of histone mRNAs occurs at subnuclear domains
    known as Histone Locus Bodies (HLBs). Although it is known that higher-order chromatin
    organization is dysregulated in cancer, structural alterations within HLB across
    breast cancer progression are unclear. Differential expression across known as
    MCF10, a basal triple negative breast cancer progression model, followed by pathway
    analysis demonstrated many alterations in signaling cascades known to be related
    to proliferation. Positional gene enrichment identified the hist1 gene locus at
    chromosome 6p22 as the most significantly altered cluster of genes from the normal-like
    MCF10A to premalignant MCF10AT1. The malignant MCF10CA1a had a more varied expression
    pattern across the hist1 locus. Within this region there are three subclusters
    of hist1 genes which were generally upregulated while intervening genes were more
    frequently downregulated. Extending these findings to TCGA breast tumors revealed
    that normal adjacent tissue had lower expression within the subclusters than their
    matched tumor samples. Moreover, the expression pattern within the hist1 locus
    comparing normal versus tumors recapitulated a very similar pattern to that comparing
    10A to AT1 or CA1a. Since the hist1 locus is transcribed and processed at a specific
    subnuclear microenvironment, the higher order chromatin organization of this locus
    may be a critical component of its regulation. We addressed whether CTCF, a key
    chromatin organizing protein, may play a role in organizing the hist1 HLB. Immunofluorescence
    for CTCF along with NPAT, a protein which decorates this locus, identified that
    CTCF may tether the hist1 HLB to the nuclear matrix. All three subclusters reside
    within a single topologically associating domain wherein interacting loops are
    bound by CTCF. Inter-subcluster interactions are lost in the premalignant AT1.
    Consistent with the varied expression across the hist1 HLB in CA1a, inter-subcluster
    interactions are regained in the malignant state. These data suggest a transient
    state in highly proliferative breast cancer cells in which the hist1 HLB is dynamically
    reorganized.
