  Summary: Rapid advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies are accelerating
    the pace of research into personalized medicine. While methods for variant discovery
    and genotyping from whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets have been well established,
    linking variants together into a single haplotype remains a challenge. An understanding
    of complete haplotypes of an individual will help clarify the consequences of
    inheriting multiple alleles in combination, identify novel disease associations,
    and augment studies of gene regulation. Although numerous methods have been developed
    to reconstruct haplotypes from WGS data, chromosome-span haplotypes at high resolution
    have been difficult to obtain. Here we present a novel method to accurately reconstruct
    chromosome-span haplotypes from proximity-ligation and DNA shotgun sequencing.
    We demonstrate the utility of this approach in producing high-resolution chromosome-span
    haplotype phasing in mouse and human. While proximity-ligation based methods were
    originally designed to investigate spatial organization of the genome, our results
    lend support for their use as a general tool for haplotyping in the future.
