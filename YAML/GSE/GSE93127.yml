  Overall-Design: Performed  in situ Hi-C, GRO-Seq,  RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq  and MeDIP-Seq,
    in combination with 3D-FISH to pinpoint the underlying molecular mechanisms by
    which diploid genomes fold into a confined geometry imposed by a multi-lobed nuclear
    architecture.

  Summary: 'Neutrophils are responsible for the first line of defense against invading
    pathogens. Their nuclei are uniquely structured as multiple lobes that establish
    a highly constrained nuclear environment. Here we found that neutrophil genomes
    were depleted of local genomic interactions but enriched for long-range genomic
    interactions that spanned multiple topologically associating domains. Population-based
    simulation of spherical and torroid genomes revealed declining radii of gyration
    for neutrophil chromosomes. We found that neutrophil genomes were highly enriched
    for heterochromatic genomic interactions across vast genomic distances, a process
    named super-contraction. Super-contraction involved genomic regions located in
    the heterochromatic compartment in both progenitors and neutrophils or genomic
    regions that switched from the euchromatic to the heterochromatic compartment
    during neutrophil differentiation.  Super-contraction was accompanied by the repositioning
    of centromeres, pericentromeres and Long-Interspersed Nuclear Elements to the
    neutrophil nuclear lamina. We found that Lamin-B Receptor expression was required
    to attach centromeric and pericentromeric repeats but not LINE-1 elements to the
    lamina. Differentiating neutrophils also repositioned rDNA and mini-nucleoli to
    the lamina: a process that was closely associated with sharply reduced rRNA expression.
    We propose that large-scale chromatin reorganization involving super-contraction
    and recruitment of heterochromatin and nucleoli to the nuclear lamina facilitate
    the folding of the neutrophil genome into a confined geometry imposed by a multi-lobed
    nuclear architecture.'
