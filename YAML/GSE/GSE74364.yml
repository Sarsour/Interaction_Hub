  Overall-Design: Hi-C experiments were performed on (i) untreated wild type swarmer
    cells and drug-treated swarmer cells (Chloramphenicol) of Caulobacter crescentus
    CB15N; (ii) on swarmer cells that are starved in M2 salts for 90 minutes; (iii)
    on swarmer cells harboring van::PrsaA_rsaA as well as derivatives of rsaA with
    a cassette of 2xTAA 2x transcription terminator inserted at 60bp, 560bp, 1060
    and 2060 bp from the transcription start site of the ectopic rsaA; (iv) on CB15N
    strain ML2000 (Plac::dnaA) at time points 90 min, 150 min, 210 min and 270 min
    after IPTG withdrawal; and (v) on CB15N strain overexpressing CtrAD51E_delta_omega
    at time point 0 min, 120 min and 180 min after addition of the inducer (xylose).      RNA-seq
    experiment were performed on RNA extracted from (i) wild-type CB15N cells growing
    at exponential phase in PYE; and (ii) wild-type CB15N cells starved in M2 salts
    for 90 min.

  Summary: Chromosomes in all organisms are highly organized and divided into multiple
    chromosomal interaction domains, or topological domains. Regions of active, high
    transcription help establish and maintain domain boundaries, but precisely how
    this occurs remains unclear. Here, using fluorescence microscopy and chromosome
    conformation capture in conjunction with deep sequencing (Hi-C), we show that
    in Caulobacter crescentus both transcription rate and transcript length, independent
    of concurrent translation, drive the formation of domain boundaries. We find that
    long, highly expressed genes do not form topological boundaries simply through
    the inhibition of supercoil diffusion. Instead, our results support a model in
    which long, active regions of transcription drive local decompaction of the chromosome,
    with these more open regions of the chromosome forming spatial gaps in vivo that
    diminish contacts between DNA in neighboring domains. These insights into the
    molecular forces responsible for domain formation in Caulobacter likely generalize
    to other bacteria and possibly eukaryotes.
