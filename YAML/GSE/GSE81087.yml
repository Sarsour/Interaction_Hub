  Summary: The 4D organization of the interphase nucleus, or the 4D Nucleome (4DN),
    reflects a dynamical interaction between 3D genome structure and function and
    its relationship to phenotype. We present initial analyses of the human 4DN, capturing
    genome-wide structure using chromosome conformation capture and 3D imaging, and
    function using RNA-sequencing. We introduce a quantitative index that measures
    underlying topological stability of a genomic region. Our results show that structural
    features of genomic regions correlate with function with surprising persistence
    over time. Furthermore, constructing genome-wide gene-level contact maps aided
    in identifying gene pairs with high potential for coregulation and colocalization
    in a manner consistent with expression via transcription factories. We additionally
    use 2D phase planes to visualize patterns in 4DN data. Finally, we evaluated gene
    pairs within a circadian gene module using 3D imaging, and found periodicity in
    the movement of clock circadian regulator and period circadian clock 2 relative
    to each other that followed a circadian rhythm and entrained with their expression.
