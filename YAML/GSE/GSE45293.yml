  Overall-Design: We carried out Hi-C experiments using HindIII and ChIP experiments
    with antibodies against BEAF, CP190, CTCF, SuHw and RNAPII on heat shocked Kc167
    cells and generated two Hi-C libraries and five ChIP-seq libraries which were
    sequenced paired-end on Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Five ChIP libraries are indexed
    with Illumina index sequencing primers.

  Summary: Metazoan chromosomes in interphase nucleus are partitioned into discrete
    three dimensional physical domains which confine epigenetically modified chromatin
    and are relative stable across different cell types even species1-4. Physical
    domains are segregated preferentially at DNase I hypersensitive sequences of high
    density of active gene and insulator proteins which are hypothesized contributing
    together to domain border formation3,4. However, whether physical domain structure
    can be maintained without insulator proteins and transcription is unknown5-8.
    Transcription of most genes and the insulator proteins binding can be severely
    impaired in heat shocked (HS) fruit fly nuclei9.  Here we show that chromatin
    contact frequency increases within and decreases beyond ~100kb after HS respectively
    accompanied by repartitioning of the Drosophila chromosomes into a different array
    of physical domain. Prominently, domains tend to merge because borders disappeared
    are more than borders newly emerged which are located more frequently in repressive
    chromatin. In contrast to previous hypothesis1,3,4, changes in insulator proteins
    enrichment and RNAPII show no noticeable difference at lost or emerged borders.
    Our results show a metazoan genome can be quickly reconfigured as cells undergo
    brief physiological stress. In addition to insulator proteins and transcription,
    we speculate that extra trans-factors binding and various biological activities
    are required for the establishment and maintenance of physical domains. Moreover,
    we found long-range chromatin interaction network is reshaped after HS implying
    long-range chromatin interactions can be formed due to domain level reorganization
    of chromosomes despite functional relevance. We anticipate our analysis to be
    a starting point for more intensive experimental investigation into the elusive
    mechanisms behind the physical domain partition and dynamic reconfiguration of
    metazoan genomes.
