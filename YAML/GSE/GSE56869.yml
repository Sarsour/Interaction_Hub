  Summary: Characterizing the relationship between genome form and function requires
    methods both for zooming out, to globally survey the genomic architectural landscape,
    and for zooming in, to investigate regions of interest at high resolution. High
    throughput methods based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) have greatly
    advanced our understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) organization of genomes,
    but are limited in resolution by their reliance on restriction enzymes. Here we
    describe a method for comprehensively mapping global chromatin contacts that uses
    DNaseI for chromatin fragmentation, leading to greatly improved efficiency and
    resolution. Coupling this method with DNA capture technology provides a high-throughput
    approach for targeted mapping of fine-scale chromatin architecture. We applied
    targeted DNase Hi-C to characterize the 3D organization of 1,030 lincRNA promoters
    in two human cell lines, and identified thousands of high-confidence lincRNA promoter-associated
    chromatin contacts at 1 kilobase pair (kbp) resolution. Detailed analysis of these
    contacts reveals that expression of lincRNAs is tightly controlled by complex
    mechanisms involving both super-enhancers and the polycomb repressive complex.
    Our results provide the first glimpse of the cell-type-specific 3D organization
    of lincRNA genes.
