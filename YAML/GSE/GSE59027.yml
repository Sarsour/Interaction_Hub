  Summary: "Mammalian chromosomes fold into arrays of megabase\u2010sized topologically\
    \ associating domains (TADs), which are arranged into compartments spanning multiple\
    \ megabases of genomic DNA. TADs have internal substructures that are often cell\
    \ type specific, but their higher\u2010order organization remains elusive. Here,\
    \ we investigate TAD higher\u2010order interactions with Hi\u2010C through neuronal\
    \ differentiation and show that they form a hierarchy of domains\u2010within\u2010\
    domains (metaTADs) extending across genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes.\
    \ We find that TAD interactions are well captured by tree\u2010like, hierarchical\
    \ structures irrespective of cell type. metaTAD tree structures correlate with\
    \ genetic, epigenomic and expression features, and structural tree rearrangements\
    \ during differentiation are linked to transcriptional state changes. Using polymer\
    \ modelling, we demonstrate that hierarchical folding promotes efficient chromatin\
    \ packaging without the loss of contact specificity, highlighting a role far beyond\
    \ the simple need for packing efficiency."
