  Summary: "In this work, we generated hundreds of millions of Hi-C paired end sequence\
    \ reads for three different human cells (RL follicular lymphoma cell line, primary\
    \ tumor B-cells from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient, and MHH-CALL-4 B-cell\
    \ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) using the Hi-C technique. An in-house\
    \ Bioinformatics software pipeline was developed and applied to map sequence reads\
    \ to the human reference genome, producing a large data set of high-quality and\
    \ high-resolution chromosome contacts. Our computational analysis on these data\
    \ reveal some interesting properties of human genome conformation, including conformational\
    \ conservation and variation of the genomes of different cells, intra- and inter-chromosomal\
    \ interactions, aberrant chromosomal translocation, spatial gene clusters, spatial\
    \ gene-gene interactions, and spatial gene-regulatory-element interaction. Furthermore,\
    \ we derived spatial interactions between functional elements (genes, transcription\
    \ factor binding sites) from the chromosomal interaction data. The data were then\
    \ used to generate chromosome-/genome-wide gene-gene interaction networks, transcription\
    \ factor binding site (TFBS) \u2013 TFBS networks, and gene-TFBS networks. Remarkably,\
    \ the connectivity in both networks shows the hallmark features of scale-free\
    \ networks, suggesting that spatial interactions of gene-gene, gene-TFBS, and\
    \ TFBS-TFBS in a genome are far from random."
