  Overall-Design: "We performed Hi-C analysis using a human fibroblast cell line IMR90\
    \ before and after NF-\u03BAB activation. In the meantime, we also performed ChIP-seq\
    \ experiments to map the location of NF-\u03BAB p65 subunit, RNA polymerase II,\
    \ p300, and several histone modifications (including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac\
    \ and H3K36me3) in IMR90 cells before and after transient TNF-\u03B1 stimulation.\
    \ Additionally, to monitor the dynamic transcription profiles, we also performed\
    \ Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq)."

  Summary: "Millions of cis-regulatory sequences have recently been found in the human\
    \ genome, but the function of most cis-elements are not yet clear, in part due\
    \ to the difficulty in determining their regulatory targets, which are often located\
    \ millions of base pairs away and separated by one or more unrelated genes. To\
    \ address this problem, the Hi-C method has been developed to identify long-range\
    \ looping interactions in a genome-wide, unbiased fashion.  However, current data\
    \ analysis of Hi-C datasets cannot fully resolve regulatory interactions between\
    \ enhancers and promoters due to the low resolution.  Here, we generated a high-depth\
    \ Hi-C dataset and applied a new analysis method that offers improved resolution\
    \ permitting genome-wide identification of nearly one million chromatin interactions.\
    \  We demonstrated the use of Hi-C to identify target promoters of enhancers regulated\
    \ by NF-\u03BAB signaling and signal-dependent dynamic chromatin interaction at\
    \ these enhancers in human cells. Surprisingly, our results showed that most NF-\u03BA\
    B binding sites are looped to their regulatory targets prior to activation of\
    \ the signaling pathway, and appear to undergo little change during signaling.\
    \ This observation suggests that the chromatin organization landscape, once established\
    \ in a cell type, is rather stable and may influence the selection and activation\
    \ of target genes by a transcription factor."
