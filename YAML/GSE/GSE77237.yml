  Summary: In the study of interphase chromosome organization, genome-wide chromosome
    conformation capture (Hi-C) maps are often generated using 2-dimensional (2D)
    monolayer cultures. These 2D cells have morphological deviations from cells that
    exist in 3-dimensional (3D) tissues in vivo, and may not maintain the same chromosome
    conformation. We used Hi-C maps to test the extent of differences in chromosome
    conformation between human fibroblasts grown in 2D cultures and those grown in
    3D spheroids. Significant differences in chromosome conformation were found between
    2D cells and those grown in spheroids. Intra-chromosomal interactions were generally
    increased in spheroid cells, with a few exceptions, while inter-chromosomal interactions
    were generally decreased. Overall, chromosomes located closer to the nuclear periphery
    had increased intra-chromosomal contacts in spheroid cells, while those located
    more centrally had decreased interactions. This study highlights the necessity
    to conduct studies on the topography of the interphase nucleus under conditions
    that mimic an in vivo environment.
