  Overall-Design: "To study dynamics in chromatin architecture and to characterize\
    \ long-range interaction, we performed Hi-C using DpnII as the restriction enzyme,\
    \ potentially reaching a genome-wide coverage at a less than 1Kb resolution. We\
    \ subsequently performed enrichment of interaction by a target capture similar\
    \ to the exome sequencing approach. We enriched for DNaseI hyper-sensitive sites\
    \ (DHS\u2019s) in chromatin from mESCs. Probes were designed against the union\
    \ of all DHS\u2019s of Serum and 2i mESCs. Capture Hi-C reveals Extremely Long-Range\
    \ Interactions (ELRI) in Serum but not in 2i ESCs. We observed H3K27me3 as a prominent\
    \ characteristic, but not exclusive feature of ELRI loci in Serum mESCs. To further\
    \ elucidate the involvement of constituents of PRC1 and PRC2 in ELRI, we performed\
    \ ChIP-seq experiment on Suz12 and Ring1B during serum-to-2i transition. In addition,\
    \ RNA-seq was performed to compare the expression levels of genes."

  Summary: Serum-to-2i interconversion of mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs) is a
    valuable in vitro model for early embryonic development. To assess whether 3D
    chromatin organization changes during this transition, we established Capture
    Hi-C with target-sequence enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive sites. We detected
    extremely long-range intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions between a small
    subset of H3K27me3 marked bivalent promoters involving the Hox clusters in serum
    grown cells. Notably, these promoter-mediated interactions are not present in
    2i ground-state pluripotent mESCs but appear upon further development into primed-like
    serum mESCs. Reverting serum mESCs to ground-state 2i mESCs removes these promoter-promoter
    interactions in a spatiotemporal manner. H3K27me3, which is largely absent at
    bivalent promoters in ground-state 2i mESCs, is necessary but not sufficient to
    establish these interactions, as confirmed by Capture Hi-C on Eed-/- serum mESCs.
    Our results implicate H3K27me3 and PRC2 as critical players in chromatin alteration
    during priming of ESCs for differentiation.
