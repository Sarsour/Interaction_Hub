  Overall-Design: Hi-C experiments were performed on wild type and mutant cells of
    Bacillus subtilis PY79 growing in rich media. ChIP-seq experiments were performed
    on cells growing in the same condition as in Hi-C experiments.

  Summary: Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play critical roles
    in chromosome dynamics in virtually all organisms but how they function remains
    poorly understood. In Bacillus subtilis, SMC condensin complexes are topologically
    loaded at centromeric sites adjacent to the replication origin. Here we provide
    evidence that these ring-shaped assemblies tether the left and right chromosome
    arms together while traveling from the origin to the terminus (>2 Mb) at rates
    >50kb/min. Condensin movement scales linearly with time arguing for an active
    transport mechanism. These data support a model in which SMC complexes function
    by processively enlarging DNA loops. Loop formation followed by processive enlargement
    provides a mechanism for how condensin complexes compact and resolve sister chromatids
    in mitosis and how cohesin generates topologically associating domains (TADs)
    during interphase.
