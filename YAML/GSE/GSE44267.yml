  Summary: Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that
    the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains.
    The boundary sequences are enriched for binding sites of CTCF and the cohesin
    complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of
    topological domains.  To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher order
    chromatin architecture in human cells, we proteolytically cleaved the cohesin
    complex from interphase chromatin and examined changes in chromosomal organization
    as well as transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromosomal interactions
    upon disruption of cohesin complex, but the topological domains remain intact.
    However, we found that depletion of CTCF by RNA interference in these cells not
    only reduced intra-domain interactions but also increased inter-domain interactions.
    Further more, distinct groups of genes become mis-regulated upon depletion of
    cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin
    contribute in different ways to chromatin organization and gene regulation.
