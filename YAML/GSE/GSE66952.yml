  Summary: Upon recruitment to active enhancers and promoters, RNA polymerase II (Pol_II)
    generates short non-coding transcripts of unclear function. The mechanisms that
    control the length and the amount of ncRNAs generated by cis-regulatory elements
    are largely unknown. Here, we show that the adapter protein WDR82 and its associated
    complexes actively limit such non-coding transcription. WDR82 targets the SET1/COMPASS
    H3K4 methyltransferase and the nuclear Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexes to
    the initiating Pol_II. WDR82 and PP1 also interact with components of the transcriptional
    termination and RNA processing machineries. Depletion of WDR82, SET1 or the PP1
    subunit required for its nuclear import caused distinct but overlapping transcription
    termination defects at highly expressed genes, active enhancers and promoters,
    thus enabling the increased synthesis of unusually long ncRNAs. These data indicate
    that transcription initiated from cis-regulatory elements is tightly coordinated
    with termination mechanisms that impose the synthesis of short RNAs.
