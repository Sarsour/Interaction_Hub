  Summary: "The extreme length of chromosomal DNA requires organizing mechanisms to\
    \ both promote functional genetic interactions and ensure faithful chromosome\
    \ segregation when cells divide. Microscopy and genome wide contact frequency\
    \ (Hi-C) analyses indicate that intra-chromosomal looping of DNA is a primary\
    \ pathway of chromosomal organization during all stages of the cell cycle (Dekker,\
    \ J. & Mirny, L. . Cell 164, 1110\u20131121 (2016). Although the enzymatic pathways\
    \ required for DNA loop formation are yet to be fully characterized, the activity\
    \ of the SMC family of proteins has been consistently associated with this process\
    \ in interphase and mitosis. Here we use Hi-C to study the reorganization of budding\
    \ yeast chromosome conformation in early mitosis and the role of SMCs in this\
    \ process. Using polymer simulations, we find that the differences between interphase\
    \ and mitotic Hi-C maps can be explained by the formation of intra-chromosomal\
    \ (cis-) loops in mitotic chromosomes. We demonstrate that mitotic SMC cohesin\
    \ activity is required for formation of cis-loops, independently of sister-chromatid\
    \ cohesion. In contrast, SMC condensin is not required for loop formation in these\
    \ early mitotic cells. Rather condensin activity promotes distinct higher order\
    \ structures in the chromosomes at centromeres and in the rDNA proximal regions.\
    \ Thus we demonstrate that cohesin-dependent cis-loops provide the primary higher\
    \ order organization of budding yeast mitotic chromosomes, independently of condensin\
    \ and sister chromatid cohesion."
