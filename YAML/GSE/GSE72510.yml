  Overall-Design: Hi-C experiments where ligation is performed on beads (tethered)
    on male Drosophila salivary glands from three independent biological replicates.  Also
    one Hi-C experiment where the ligation is performed in solution (conventional).

  Summary: Chemical cross-linking and high-throughput sequencing have revealed regions
    of intra-chromosomal interaction, referred to as topologically associating domains
    (TADs), interspersed with regions of little or no such interaction, in interphase
    nuclei. We find that TADs and the regions between them correspond with the bands
    and interbands of polytene chromosomes of Drosophila. We further establish the
    conservation of TADs between polytene and diploid cells of Drosophila. From direct
    measurements on light micrographs of polytene chromosomes, we then deduce the
    states of chromatin folding in the diploid cell nucleus. Two states of chromatin
    folding, fully extended fibers containing regulatory regions and promoters, and
    fibers condensed up to ten-fold containing coding regions of active genes, constitute
    the euchromatin of the nuclear interior. Chromatin fibers condensed up to 30-fold,
    containing coding regions of inactive genes, represent the heterochromatin of
    the nuclear periphery. A convergence of molecular analysis with direct observation
    thus reveals the architecture of interphase chromosomes.
