  Overall-Design: Hi-C and RNA-seq  experiments were conducted in MCF-10A shSCRAM
    and shSMARCA4 cells.  SMARCA4 ChIP-seq was conducted in wildtype MCF-10A cells.  Hi-C
    was performed by using the HindIII restriction enzyme.

  Summary: The packaging of DNA into chromatin plays an important role in transcriptional
    regulation and nuclear processes. Brahma related gene-1 SMARCA4 (also known as
    BRG1), the essential ATPase subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
    complex, uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt nucleosomes at target
    regions. Although the transcriptional role of SMARCA4 at gene promoters is well-studied,
    less is known about its role in higher-order genome organization. SMARCA4 knockdown
    in human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells resulted in 176 up-regulated genes,
    including many related to lipid and calcium metabolism, and 1292 down-regulated
    genes, some of which encode extracellular matrix (ECM) components that can exert
    mechanical forces and affect nuclear structure. ChIP-seq analysis of SMARCA4 localization
    and SMARCA4-bound super-enhancers demonstrated extensive binding at intergenic
    regions. Furthermore, Hi-C analysis showed extensive SMARCA4-mediated alterations
    in higher-order genome organization at multiple resolutions. First, SMARCA4 knockdown
    resulted in clustering of intra- and inter- sub-telomeric regions, demonstrating
    a novel role for SMARCA4 in telomere organization. SMARCA4 binding was enriched
    at TAD (Topologically Associating Domain) boundaries, and SMARCA4 knockdown resulted
    in weakening of TAD boundary strength. Taken together, these findings provide
    a dynamic view of SMARCA4-dependent changes in higher-order chromatin organization
    and gene expression, identifying SMARCA4 as a novel component of chromatin organization.
