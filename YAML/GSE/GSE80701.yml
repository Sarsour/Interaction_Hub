  Summary: In this study, we further characterized the hkCP and dCP enhancers, which
    were identified by STARR-seq, and shown to have an intrinsic capacity to interact
    with a specific type of core promoter depending on the presence of a DRE motif
    [9]. hkCP enhancers are marked by H3K4me3, associated with TAD borders, and mediate
    large TSS-clustered interactions to promote robust transcription. Furthermore,
    they contain the architectural proteins CAP-H2, Chromator, DREF and Z4. In contrast,
    dCP enhancers are marked by H3K4me1, associated with chromatin loop anchors and
    are more commonly associated with single TSS-contacts. dCP enhancers are depleted
    of the hkCP-specific architectural proteins and show an enrichment for Fs(1)h-L
    and Rad21 instead. Thus, our data supports the model that the unique occupancy
    of architectural proteins in the distinct enhancer classes are key contributors
    to the types of interactions that enhancers can mediate genome-wide, ultimately
    affecting enhancer-promoter specificity.
