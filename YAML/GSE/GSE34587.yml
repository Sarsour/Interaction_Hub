  Summary: As the most widely used mammalian model organism, mice play a critical
    role in biomedical research for mechanistic study of human development and diseases.
    Today, functional sequences in the mouse genome are still poorly annotated a decade
    after its initial sequencing. We report here a map of nearly 300,000 cis-regulatory
    sequences in the mouse genome, representing active promoters, enhancers and CTCF
    binding sites in a diverse set of 19 tissues and cell types. This map provides
    functional annotation to nearly 11% of the genome, and over 70% of conserved,
    non-coding sequences. We define tissue-specific enhancers and identify potential
    transcription factors regulating gene expression in each tissue or cell type.
    Finally, we demonstrate that cis-regulatory sequences are organized into domains
    of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. Our results provide a valuable
    resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome, and
    study of regulatory mechanisms for tissue-specific gene expression.
