  Extract-Protocol: "Between 25 to 50 x 10e7 cells were used to perform in-nucleus\
    \ ligation 3C; biotin fill-in was omitted. Briefly, adherent cells (mES) were\
    \ incubated in the presence of trypsin (Biological Industries 03-053-1) for 8-10\
    \ minutes max at 37\xB0C and passed through a cell strainer after harvesting to\
    \ ensure a single-cell suspension. Cells (including K562 from now on) were washed\
    \ 1x with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended PBS/FBS 10% and cross-linked\
    \ in formaldehyde final concentration of 2% for 5 minutes at room temperature.\
    \ After quenching with 0.125 M glycine and wash with PBS, cells were incubated\
    \ in permeabilization buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2 % NP-40\
    \ alternative (CALBIOCHEM 492016), Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (P8340 Sigma))\
    \ for 60 minutes at 4\xB0C while slowly mixing. Cells were split into 5 M cell\
    \ aliquots and washed 2x with cold PBS. After the second wash, cell pellets were\
    \ then flash frozen on liquid nitrogen. Pellets were resuspended on 175.5 \xB5\
    l H2O and 24.5 \xB5l DpnII RE buffer 10x. After addition of 3 \xB5l of 20% SDS\
    \ (final concentration of 0.3%), cells were incubated for 60 minutes at 37\xB0\
    C while agitating (750 RPM). Triton X-100 20% was added to a final concentration\
    \ of 1.8% and incubated for 60 min at 37\xB0C. Aliquots were then digested with\
    \ 15 \xB5l HC DpnII (NEB 50,000 U/ml) ON. Cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes\
    \ at 600 g and washed 1x with PBS. Incubation of pellets for 20 minutes at 65\xB0\
    C was performed in order to heat-inactivate any DpnII residue. In-nucleus ligation\
    \ was then performed incubating cells on ligation mix (415 \xB5l H2O, 5 \xB5l\
    \ BSA (10mg/ml NEB) and 5 \xB5l T4 ligation enzyme NEB (2x106 U/ml)) ON at 16\xB0\
    C.  Cross-link was reversed by incubating aliquots with 10 mg/ml proteinase K\
    \ (Roche) at 65\xB0C ON followed by the addition of 15 \xB5l of RNase A (Roche)\
    \ for 45 minutes at 37\xB0C. DNA was purified with AmpureXP SPRI beads 1x (Beckman\
    \ Coulter; A63881) with two elution rounds of 100 \xB5l each with the aim of size\
    \ selecting for the high molecular weight portion of the sample.\nHi-C: Bioruptor\
    \ Microtubes (C30010015) to reach a DNA fragment size between 400-500 bp. The\
    \ sonicated DNA  was then subjected to end-repair reaction (5 \xB5l 10x end-repair\
    \ buffer + 2.5 \xB5l end-repair mix (NEB E6050L)) at 20 \xB0C for 30 minutes.\
    \ The DNA was cleaned up with 2.2x SPRI beads and eluted in 38 \xB5l EB. A-tailing\
    \ reaction was performed with 5 \xB5l NEB buffer 2, 4 \xB5l Klenow fragment -3\u2032\
    -5\u2032 exo (NEB M0212M) and 10 \xB5l dATP 10 nM for 30 minutes at 37 \xB0C,\
    \ cleaned up with 2.2 x SPRI beads and eluted in 30 \xB5l EB. DNA template was\
    \ ligated with 5 \xB5l Illumina indexed adapters 0.75 \xB5M with 5 \xB5l T4 quick\
    \ ligase (NEB M2200) and 40 \xB5l 10x ligase buffer for 15 minutes at 25 \xB0\
    C. Ligated template was then cleaned up with 1.3x SPRI beads and eluted in 41\
    \ \xB5l."

Data-Processing: 'Cwalks from PacBio reads were assembled using the cwalk pipeline
  with default parameters although the shotgun assembly step was not necessary. Components
  were directly transformed from fenchain files into cadj format

  Hi-C reads were processed using the same Cwalk pipeline with the difference that
  adj files can directly represent the pair-wise information of genome contacts.

  reads were mapped using bowtie2 with --reorder --local for cwalks and HiC

  Genome_build: hg19 and mm9
