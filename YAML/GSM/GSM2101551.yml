  Extract-Protocol: 'In situ Hi-C was performed as described in Rao et al (2014) [PMID:
    25497547] using MboI to digest the chromatin. The Hi-C library was amplified directly
    from the T1 beads with 9 cycles of PCR, using Illumina primers and protocol (Illumina,
    2007). To capture promoter interactions, the Hi-C library was hybridyzed to 81,735
    biotinylated 120 bp custom RNA probes (Custom Array) targeting the 4 nearest MboI
    restriction fragment ends (restriction fragments longer than 200 bp) around human
    RefSeq promoters in hg19. Twelve cycles of PCR were performed in the captured
    library.'
  Growth-Protocol: 'LCL''s were grown according to Battle et al (2015) [PMID: 25657249]'

  Basecalls performed with Illumina bcl2fastq2-v2.17.1.14 by the Functional Genomics
  Facility at the University of Chicago

  Read mates were independently aligned to hg19 with bowtie2-2.2.3 with --local --mm
  --very-sensitive-local

  Reads with MAPQ < 10 were filtered out

  Reads were paired using a custom script

  Cis interactions were called using HOMER with -res 2000 and -superRes 10000, -superRes
  20000
