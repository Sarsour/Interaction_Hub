  Extract-Protocol: 'Hundreds of millions of Hi-C paired-end sequence reads for three
    different human cells (RL follicular lymphoma cell line, primary tumor B-cells
    from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient, and MHH-CALL-4 B-cell acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia cell line) using the Hi-C technique.

    Hi-C libraries were created  for a case of primary human B-acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia (B-ALL), the MHH-CALL-4 B-ALL cell line (CALL4), and the follicular lymphoma
    cell-line (RL). These libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. High-quality
    paired-end reads of 39M, 79M, and 33M were obtained for these cells, respectively.'

Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C seq\nThese libraries were sequenced using\
  \ an Illumina HiSeq 2000\nSoftware Maq was used to map each read-pair to the reference\
  \ human genomes (NCBI build 36.3), where parameter \u201Csum of mismatching base\
  \ qualities (-e)\u201D controlling the tolerance of mismatches was set to 150 in\
  \ most experiments.\nData were filtered using the following specifications\u2026\
  \nMaq outputs the base pair positions in the reference genomes where each DNA read\
  \ is mapped to. The mapped positions were analyzed by our method to generate chromosomal\
  \ contacts\nAn in-house bioinformatics software pipeline was developed and applied\
  \ to map sequence reads to the human reference genome, producing a large data set\
  \ of high-quality and high-resolution chromosome contacts\nGenome_build: NCBI build\
  \ 36.3\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content: The processed data file is tab delimited\
  \ with five columns. The column headers are; Mapping ID, chromosome number 1, chromosome\
  \ location 1, chromosome number 2, chromosome location 2. The Mapping ID is the\
  \ key assigned during Mapping for each sequence. The chromosome number and location\
  \ respectively correspond to the id and location of the chromosome being mapped."
