  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were conducted using HindIII according to previous
    publication (Lieberman-Aiden, E. et al. Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions
    reveals folding principles of the human genome. Science 326, 289-93 (2009).).

    Sequencing libraries were constructed according to previous publication (Lieberman-Aiden,
    E. et al. Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles
    of the human genome. Science 326, 289-93 (2009).).'
  Growth-Protocol: Tissues samples were obtained from deceased donors at the time
    of organ procurement at the Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, USA).  Samples
    were flash frozen and pulverized prior to formaldehyde cross-linking.  Research
    consent from family was obtained, and this study was approved by Mid-American
    Transplant Services.

Data-Processing: "library strategy: HaploSeq\nfastq:  Illumina's HiSeq Control Software\n\
  For Hi-C read alignment, we aligned Hi-C reads to the hg18 (human) genome. We masked\
  \ any bases in the genome that were genotyped as SNPs in the individual genome.\
  \ These bases were masked to \u201CN\u201D in order to reduce reference bias mapping\
  \ artifacts. Hi-C reads were aligned as single end reads using Novoalign. After\
  \ mapping was finished, read pairs were re-constructed from single reads using an\
  \ in house pipeline.  Unmapped reads were filtered out and PCR duplicate reads were\
  \ removed.\nHaplotypes were generated from the final aligned bam file using the\
  \ HapCUT algorithm.  The details of HapCUT are described previously (Bansal and\
  \ Bafna, Bioinformatics 24, i153-159, 2008).\nThe final processed haplotypes were\
  \ generateds after removing local biases through following three steps. First the\
  \ alignment biases were removed by aligning simulated reads spanning surrounding\
  \ variants location. If there is more than 5% difference between alleles those variant\
  \ loci were considered to subject an inherent mapping bias. Second, we removed alleles\
  \ located in copy number variable regions and allelic biased copy number variable\
  \ regions by comparing the coverage between two alleles based on WGS data. Any variants\
  \ that had more coverage than three standard deviation above the mean of each haplotype\
  \ were excluded. Any variants showing biased WGS coverage between two alleles were\
  \ also excluded (binomial test p-value 0.05 after Benjamini correction). Lastly,\
  \ we remove erroneously called as heterozygous variant during genotyping. We calculated\
  \ the probability of each heterozygous variants were actually homozygous from the\
  \ likelihood of observing the coverage on each allele from whole genome sequencing.\
  \ Only heterozygous SNPs that had a FDR of less than 0.5% were included in downstream\
  \ analysis.\nHaploSeq generates two haplotypes for each chromosome, one for the\
  \ maternal allele and one for the paternal allele. One allele is named as P1 (parent1)\
  \ and another allele is named as P2 (parent2) since we do not have information regarding\
  \ the parent of origin in each donor genome. For the chr9 we can generate haplotypes\
  \ in each chromosome arm. The haplotypes in chrX STL002 was independtly generated\
  \ based on hg19 genome build.\nGenome_build: hg18\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content:\
  \ The processed haplotypes for the individual genome (\"*_haps.vcf\") are available\
  \ in VCF format."
