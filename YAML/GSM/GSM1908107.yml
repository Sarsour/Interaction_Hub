Data-Processing: "Illumina Casava software 1.8.2  used for basecalling of Hiseq2000\
  \ and NextSeq 500 data.\nLibrary strategy: ChIP-seq. The reads were aligned to build\
  \ version mm9 of the mouse genome using bwa (version 0.7.12) with default parameters.\
  \ Only uniquely mapped reads were kept for downstream analysis. Reads from PCR duplicates\
  \ were also removed. MACS (version 2.0.10.20130306), was used to identify regions\
  \ of ChIP-seq enrichment over background using parameters --nomodel --broad.\nLibrary\
  \ strategy: RNA-seq. MMSEQ package was used to infer gene expression levels. Reads\
  \ were mapped to mouse gene annotation (Ensemble release 67).\nLibrary strategy:\
  \ Capture Hi-C. The two ends of paired-end reads were mapped to the reference mouse\
  \ genome (mm9) separately, using BWA MEM (version 0.7.12) with default parameters.\
  \ Reads were filtered based on mapping quality score (both ends mapQ \u2265 10)\
  \ and PCR duplicates were removed. Reads were removed if the two ends are from the\
  \ same DpnII fragment. CHICAGO CHi-C analysis package (http://regulatorygenomicsgroup.org/chicago)\
  \ was used to call significant contacts. To increase quality, the whole genome was\
  \ windowed into 5 DpnII site tiles. Virtual baits were created by merging adjacent\
  \ target regions. Interactions were filtered based on interaction score and number\
  \ of reads (score \u2265 5 and at least 5 reads).\nLibrary strategy: DNaseI-seq.\
  \ The reads were aligned to build version mm9 of the mouse genome using bwa (version\
  \ 0.7.12) with default parameters. Only uniquely mapped reads were kept for downstream\
  \ analysis. Reads from PCR duplicates were also removed. MACS (version 2.0.10.20130306),\
  \ was used to identify DNaseI hyper-sensitive sites using parameters --nomodel --broad.\n\
  Library strategy: 4C-seq. The initial step in the 4C-seq analysis is the alignment\
  \ of the sequencing reads to a reduced genome of sequences that flank HindIII sites\
  \ (fragment ends). Repetitive fragment ends were excluded from subsequent analysis.\
  \ The reduced genome was based on mouse genome mm9.\nGenome_build: mm9"
