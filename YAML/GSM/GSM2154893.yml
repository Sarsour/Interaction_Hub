  Extract-Protocol: "Cell pellets were incubated in 50 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (10\
    \ mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA-630, protease inhibitor cocktail\
    \ (Roche)) for 30 minutes on ice, followed by a centrifugation to pellet the cell\
    \ nuclei (650 x g for 5 minutes). Nuclei were resuspended in 1.25 x NEBuffer 2,\
    \ SDS was added (0.3% final concentration) and the nuclei were incubated at 37\u02DA\
    C with agitation (950 rpm) for one hour. Triton X-100 was added at a final concentration\
    \ of 1.7 % and the nuclei were incubated at 37\u02DAC with agitation (950 rpm)\
    \ for one hour. Restriction digest was performed overnight at 37\u02DAC with agitation\
    \ (950 rpm) with HindIII (NEB; 1500 units per 5 million cells). The restriction\
    \ sites were then filled in with Klenow (NEB) using biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies),\
    \ dCTP, dGTP and dTTP (all at a final concentration of 30 \xB5M) for 60 minutes\
    \ at 37\u02DAC. After addition of SDS (1.42 % final concentration) and incubation\
    \ at 65\u02DAC with agitation (950 rpm) for 25 minutes, ligation was performed\
    \ for four hours at 16\u02DAC (50 units T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies) per\
    \ 5 million cells starting material) in a total volume of 8.2 ml ligation buffer\
    \ (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, 100 \xB5g/ml BSA, 0.9 % Triton\
    \ X-100) per 5 million cells starting material. Reverse crosslinking (65\u02DA\
    C overnight in the presence of Proteinase K (Roche)) was followed by RNase A (Roche)\
    \ treatment and two sequential phenol/chloroform extractions. The DNA was precipitated\
    \ in the presence of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.2 (1/10 volume) and ethanol (2.5\
    \ x volumes) overnight at -20\u02DAC. After three consecutive washes with 70%\
    \ ethanol, the DNA concentration was determined using Quant-iT Pico Green (Life\
    \ Technologies). 40 \xB5g of Hi-C library DNA were incubated with T4 DNA polymerase\
    \ (NEB) for 4 hours at 20\u02DAC to remove of biotin from non-ligated fragment\
    \ ends, followed by phenol/chloroform purification and DNA precipitation overnight\
    \ at -20\u02DAC, followed by a 70% ethanol wash.\nSonication was performed to\
    \ obtain DNA fragments with a size peak around 400 bp (Covaris E220 settings:\
    \ duty factor: 10%; peak incident power: 140W; cycles per burst: 200; time: 55\
    \ seconds). The sonicated DNA was end-repaired (T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polynucleotide\
    \ kinase, Klenow (all NEB)) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by DNA\
    \ purification (Qiagen PCR purification kit). dATP was added with Klenow exo-\
    \ (NEB) for 30 minutes at 37\u02DAC, and the enzyme was heat-inactivated (20 minutes\
    \ at 65\u02DAC). A double size selection using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter)\
    \ was performed: first, the ratio of AMPure XP beads solution volume to DNA sample\
    \ volume was adjusted to 0.6:1. After incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature,\
    \ the sample was transferred to a magnetic separator (DynaMag-2 magnet; Life Technologies),\
    \ and the supernatant was transferred to a new eppendorf tube. The ratio of AMPure\
    \ XP beads solution volume to DNA sample volume was then adjusted to 0.9:1 final.\
    \ After incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature, the sample was transferred\
    \ to a magnet (DynaMag-2 magnet; Life Technologies). Following two washes with\
    \ 70% ethanol, the DNA was eluted in 100 \xB5l of TLE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0;\
    \ 0.1 mM EDTA). Biotin-marked ligation products were isolated using MyOne Streptavidin\
    \ C1 Dynabeads (Life Technologies) on a DynaMag-2 magnet (Life Technologies) in\
    \ binding buffer (5 mM Tris pH8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) for 30 minutes at room\
    \ temperature, followed by two washes in binding buffer, and one wash in ligation\
    \ buffer (NEB). PE adapters (Illumina) were ligated onto Hi-C ligation products\
    \ bound to streptavidin beads for 2 hours at room temperature (T4 DNA ligase NEB,\
    \ in ligation buffer, slowly rotating). After washes in wash buffer (5 mM Tris,\
    \ 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) and binding buffer, the DNA-bound beads\
    \ were resuspended in a final volume of 30 \xB5l NEBuffer 2. Bead-bound Hi-C DNA\
    \ was amplified with 7 PCR amplification cycles using PE PCR 1.0 and PE PCR 2.0\
    \ primers (Illumina). The concentration and size distribution of Hi-C library\
    \ DNA after PCR amplification was determined by Bioanalyzer profiles (Agilent\
    \ Technologies). To capture ligation products containing promoter sequences, 500\
    \ ng of Hi-C library DNA was lyophilized using a vacuum concentrator (Savant SPD\
    \ 2010) at 45\u02DAC. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 3.4 \xB5l H2O, and custom\
    \ hybridization blockers (Agilent Technologies) were added to the Hi-C DNA. Hybridization\
    \ buffers and the custom-made RNA capture bait system (Agilent Technologies: biotinylated\
    \ RNAs targeting the HindIII restriction fragment ends of 22,225 mouse gene promoters,\
    \ and of 21,841 human gene promoters, respectively) were prepared according to\
    \ the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (SureSelect Target Enrichment, Agilent\
    \ Technologies). The Hi-C library DNA was mixed with hybridization buffer, denatured\
    \ for 5 minutes at 95\u02DAC, and then incubated with the capture bait system\
    \ at 65\u02DAC. After 24 hours, biotin pulldown (MyOne Streptavidin T1 Dynabeads;\
    \ Life Technologies) and washes were performed following the SureSelect Target\
    \ enrichment protocol (Agilent Technologies). After the final wash, the beads\
    \ were resuspended in 30 \xB5l NEBuffer 2, without prior DNA elution. A post-capture\
    \ PCR (four amplification cycles using Illumina PE PCR 1.0 and PE PCR 2.0 primers)\
    \ was performed and the Capture Hi-C libraries were paired-end sequenced (HiSeq\
    \ 1000, Illumina)."
  Growth-Protocol: GM12878 cell culture conditions  GM12878 cells were obtained from
    the Coriell Cell Repositories and grown in suspension in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
    with 2 mM glutamine, 15% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin under standard culture
    conditions.    Mouse ESC culture conditions  J1 (129S4/SvJae) murine ESCs were
    expanded on irradiated primary embryonic fibroblasts under standard pluripotent
    conditions (15% FBS) on tissue culture plates coated with 0.1% gelatin. To harvest
    the cells and remove contaminating feeder cells, ESCs were trypsinized and passaged
    twice for 30 min each.

  Treatment-Protocol: "30 to 40 million cells were fixed in 2 % formaldehyde (Agar\
    \ Scientific) for 10 minutes, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of\
    \ ice-cold glycine (0.125 M final concentration). Cells were collected (centrifugation\
    \ 400 x g for 10 minutes), washed with PBS, and collected again (400 x g for 10\
    \ minutes). The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was immediately frozen\
    \ in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u02DAC."
