Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C\nHi-C was performed as previously described\
  \ (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009 Science, Belton JM et al., 2012 Methods). Briefly,\
  \ Cells were lysed and chromatin was digested with HindIII, then digested ends were\
  \ filled in with biotinylated dCTP  and ligated.  After reversing the formaldehyde\
  \ crosslinks by incubation at 65 C  with Proteinase K overnight, unligated biotinylated\
  \ ends were removed by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase.  To obtain allele-specific\
  \ Hi-C interaction maps in female ESCs (XacastXa129) and a derived clonal NPC line\
  \ (XacastXi129) (Methods; Extended Data Figure 1) (20), we first constructed an\
  \ allelic genome using the reference mm9 genome and all 19,722,473 SNPs. The allelic\
  \ (Cast and 129) genomes were then combined to create a reference diploid genome\
  \ (consisting of 44 chromosomes; 1-19 X,Y,M). All reads were aligned to the diploid\
  \ genome (as described in ref. (31)), thus allowing for a competitive mapping strategy\
  \ between the two alleles. All reads were trimmed to 50bp and then aligned using\
  \ the novoCraft novoalign (v 3.02.00) software package. Reads were aligned using\
  \ the following options (-r all 5 -R 30 -q 2 -n 50, minimumReadDistance=5). The\
  \ best alignment was selected from the list of the top 5 alignments. The alignment\
  \ was considered unique (allelic), if it\u2019s alignment score was = 5 from the\
  \ 2nd best alignment score (alignment score taken from the ZQ tag). Reads that aligned\
  \ uniquely to an allele were classified as allelic (either Cast or 129) whereas\
  \ reads that aligned to both alleles equally (= 5 distance) were classified as ambiguous\
  \ (AMB) (Extended Data Figure 1d). Uniquely aligned Hi-C interactions between loci\
  \ located on the same chromosome were assigned to a specific parental chromosome\
  \ in cis when at least one of the two reads contained a diagnostic SNP, and the\
  \ other either contained a SNP from the same allele, or mapped to both alleles (32).\
  \ We obtained the following paired-end read counts: For ESC (GUR.2d), a total of\
  \ 401,684,614 interactions could be aligned, 372,272,389 of which were unique (after\
  \ PCR duplicate filter), and 95,650,438 of which could be placed to either the Cast\
  \ or 129 allele (25.69%). For NPC (GEI.72b), a total of 277,440,656 interactions\
  \ could be aligned, 253,254,798 of which were unique (after PCR duplicate filter),\
  \ and 82,323,031 of which could be placed to either the Cast or 129 allele (32.51%).\
  \ For deltaFT NPC (D9B2/B129T3), a total of 229,331,123 interactions could be aligned,\
  \ 222,941,525 of which were unique (after PCR duplicate filter), and 85,331,870\
  \ of which could be placed to either the Cast or 129 allele (38.28%). The difference\
  \ in percent of reads assignable to either allele is likely due to differences in\
  \ the percent of cis interactions found in each sample (biological or technical\
  \ variation). The 82-95 million read depth supported generation of allele-specific\
  \ chromatin interaction maps at multiple resolutions (10 Mb, 2.5 Mb, 1 Mb, 500 kb,\
  \ 250 kb, 100 kb, and 40 kb).\nIterative mapping and error filtering/iterative correction\
  \ (IC) of the chromatin interaction data were performed as previously described\
  \ (12,31)) . IC was performed on the diploid (44 chromosomes) (replicate pooled)\
  \ genome-wide matrix for all resolutions\nHi-C for the mTXY (male) samples was performed\
  \ as previously described 27,28. Reads originating from the mTXY (male) sample was\
  \ aligned to the mm9 reference genome. Iterative mapping and error filtering/iterative\
  \ correction (IC) of the chromatin interaction data were performed as previously\
  \ described. IC was performed genome-wide (22 chromosomes) (replicate pooled) on\
  \ the genome-wide matrix for all resolutions.  Biological replicates were highly\
  \ correlated.  We pooled all biological replicates into a single Hi-C data set per\
  \ sample and subsequently used the pooled data for all analyses.\nHi-C SNP density\
  \ filter: To remove potential biases in the Hi-C data related to the density of\
  \ SNPs in each bin, we calculated the number of SNPs residing in each genomic interval\
  \ (bin) for all Hi-C bins across all bin sizes. We then calculated the median number\
  \ of SNPs per bin, and produced a minimum required SNP density cutoff defined as\
  \ the (median - 1.5 * IQR). Any bins with less SNP than the cutoff were removed\
  \ from all analyses. The SNP density cutoffs used for each bin size were: 40 kb,\
  \ 43 SNPs; 100 kb, 216 SNPs; 250 kb, 776.5 SNPs; 500kb, 1767.25 SNPs. The non SNP\
  \ density filtered data was only used for visualization purposes (figure heatmaps).\
  \ For all intensive purposes, we refer to IC Hi-C as data that has been IC\u2019\
  d and run through the snp-density filter.\nCompartment analysis:  The presence and\
  \ location of the A/B-compartments were calculated as previously described (14)\
  \ (ref Crane Meyer 2015). Compartments were derived from the 250 kb IC Hi-C data\
  \ for each chromosome separately using the CIS maps for each sample / allele (Fig\
  \ 1). The code used to generate the compartments (PC1 from PCA analysis) will be\
  \ publically available on github following publication (matrix2compartment.pl).\
  \ Compartments were generated all default options except the (cis alpha) option,\
  \ set to (-ca 0.005).\nInsulation and Boundary calculation:  TAD structure (insulation/boundaries)\
  \ was defined via the insulation method as previously described with minor modifications\
  \ (14). The code used to calculate the insulation score will be publically available\
  \ on github following publication (matrix2insulation.pl). Insulation vectors were\
  \ detected using the following options: (-is 480000 -ids 320000 -im iqrMean -nt\
  \ 0 -ss 160000 -yb 1.5 -nt 0 -bmoe 0). The output of the insulation script is a\
  \ vector of insulation scores, and a list of minima along the insulation vector\
  \ (inferred as TAD boundaries). The TAD boundaries were not used in this study.\n\
  RNA-Seq:  RNA-Seq data for the ESC (GUR.2d) and NPC (GEI.72b) was obtained from\
  \ previously published work (20). RNA-Seq data for the mutant NPC (D9B2/B129T3)\
  \ was obtained and processed as previously described (20).\nRNA-Seq \u2018Expressed/Escapee\u2019\
  \ classification:  The allelic RPKM values were derived for each gene by splitting\
  \ the RPKM value by the 129 ratio. 129 RPKM = (RPKM * 129 ratio); Cast RPKM = (RPKM\
  \ * (1 - 129 ratio)); Any gene with an allelic RPKM value = 3 RPMK was classified\
  \ as being expressed. Any gene expressed on the Xi was classified as being an escapee.\n\
