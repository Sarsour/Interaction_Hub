  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were performed using either BglII or NcoI according
    to previous publications (Umbarger MA. 2012. Chromosome conformation capture assays
    in bacteria. PMID: 22776362 and Lieberman-Aiden, E. et al., 2009. Comprehensive
    mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.
    PMID: 19815776). RNA were extracted using Hot Trizol. Detailed protocols are listed
    in the Supplementary Materials

  Growth-Protocol: 'Caulobacter crescentus were grown as described previously in Skerker
    et al., 2005 (PMID: 16176121). When appropriate, media were supplemented with
    antibiotics at the following concentrations (liquid/solid media) [ug/ml]): chloramphenicol
    (1/2), kanamycin (5/25), oxytetracycline (1/2), spectinomycin (25/100). Synchronizations
    were performed on mid-exponential phase cells using Percoll (GE Healthcare) and
    density gradient centrifugation as described previously in Jones et al., 2001
    (PMID: 11283290). After synchronization, swarmer cells were fixed formadehyde
    for chromosome conformation capture and Hi-C analysis. For antibiotic treatments,
    swarmer cells were incubated with 50 ug/mL chloramphenicol (final concentration)
    for 30 minutes before fixing with formadehyde. For starvation experiment, swarmer
    cells were released into M2 salts for 90min before fixing with formadehyde.'

  Treatment-Protocol: 'Swarmer cells were isolated by density gradient method according
    to Jones et al., 2001 (PMID: 11283290). Swarmer cells were released into PYE and
    fixed immediately by 1% formadehyde.'

Data-Processing: 'For Hi-C, Reads from each end of a DNA fragment were represented
  in each of the two FASTQ files generated by Illumina paired-end sequencing.

  For Hi-C, we mapped reads in each FASTQ file back to the genome of Caulobacter CB15N
  (NA1000) independently by Bowtie version 0.12.7 to preserve the order of reads.
  All the processing steps afterwards were performed using an in-house Perl scripts.
  For RNA-seq, the same mapping procedure was used as for Hi-C but coverage was computed
  using BEDTools instead (Quinlan and Hall, 2010).

  The two resulting SAM files were then merged together. Unaligned reads were discarded.

  The Caulobacter CB15N (NA1000) genome was then divided into restriction fragments
  (700 BglII fragments and 2025 NcoI fragments). Each aligned read was sorted into
  its corresponding restriction fragment. We inferred that a DNA fragment resulted
  from non-ligation or self-ligation if reads from both ends were from the same restriction
  fragment; these reads were discarded. Only DNA fragments for which the reads came
  from different restriction fragments were retained and used for construction of
  a Hi-C contact map.

  The genome of Caulobacter CB15N was then divided into bins of either 20 kb (for
  BglII Hi-C) or 10 kb (for NcoI Hi-C due to higher cutting frequency of NcoI compared
  to BglII) and the remaining reads were allocated to their corresponding bin. We
  then counted the number of fragments having reads with in different bins. A raw
  Hi-C contact map is the matrix of read counts in which each entry, mij, indicates
  the number of fragments with ends mapping to bins i and j. The raw Hi-C contact
  map/matrix is biased due to the uneven distribution of restriction enzyme sites
  and, to a lesser extent, differences in GC content and the mappability of individual
  reads. We normalized raw contact maps using an iterative normalization procedure
  (Imakaev et al., 2012 PMID:    22941365). Essentially, we converted the number of
  interactions, or read counts, into Hi-C scores by applying the following equation
  and iteratively repeating it for the resulting contact map after each cycle:  mij
  =mij * (total reads) / (total reads in bin i * total reads in bin j). Ten iterative
  normalization rounds were performed. Subsequent analysis and visualisation was done
  using Perl and R scripts.
