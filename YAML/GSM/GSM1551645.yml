  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked and then lysed with nuclei permeabilized\
    \ but still intact. DNA was then restricted and the overhangs filled in incorporating\
    \ a biotinylated base. Free ends were then ligated together in situ. Crosslinks\
    \ were reversed, the DNA was sheared to 300-500bp and then biotinylated ligation\
    \ junctions were recovered with streptavidin beads.\nstandard Illumina library\
    \ construction protocol, Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of\
    \ T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and\
    \ T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow\
    \ fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for\
    \ ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the\
    \ 3\u2019 end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers\
    \ for 8-12 cycles and library fragments of 400-600 bp (insert plus adaptor and\
    \ PCR primer sequences) were purified using SPRI beads. The purified DNA was captured\
    \ on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on\
    \ the MiSeq/HiSeq2000/HiSeq2500 following the manufacturer's protocols"

  The paired end reads were aligned separately using BWA against the b37 human build
  or the mm9 mouse build

  PCR duplicates, low mapping quality and unligated reads were removed using an in-house
  Hi-C analysis pipeline (see Rao, Huntley, et al)

  Contact matrices were constructed at various resolutions and normalized using an
  in-house Hi-C analysis pipeline (see Rao, Huntley, et al)

  loops were annotated using HiCCUPS (see Rao, Huntley, et al), domains were annotated
  using Arrowhead (see Rao, Huntley, et al), subcompartments were annotated using
  a Gaussian HMM (see Rao, Huntley, et al)

  Genome_build: b37 (human), mm9 (mouse)

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: HiCCUPS_looplist.txt files contain loop
  calls generated via HiCCUPS; first three fields represent the locus participating
  in the loop closer to the p-end of the chromosome; fields 4-6 represent the locus
  participating in the loop closer to the q-end of the chromosome; field 7 represents
  the color used to display the feature in Juicebox (a Hi-C data visualization software,
  see www.aidenlab.org/juicebox); field 8 represents the observed number of counts
  at the loop; fields 9-12 represent the expected number of counts at the loop using
  four different expected models; fields 13-16 are the q-values over each of the expected
  values; field 17 is the number of enriched pixels that was clustered into a particular
  loop; field 18-19 are the centroid of the loop; field 20 is the radius of the loop

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Arrowhead_domainlist.txt files contain domain
  calls generated via Arrowhead; first 6 fields represent the boundaries of the domain;
  field 7 represents the color used to display the feature in Juicebox (a Hi-C data
  visualization software, see www.aidenlab.org/juicebox); field 8 is the corner score
  for the domain (see Rao, Huntley, et al); fields 9-12 are the component scores used
  in the Arrowhead algorithm (see Rao, Huntley, et al)

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: the subcompartment bed file contains the
  coordinates of the 6 nuclear subcompartments identified in Rao, Huntley, et al.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: HIC*_merged_nodups.txt files specify each
  Hi-C read pair (i.e., the mapping locations of each individual read pair).'
