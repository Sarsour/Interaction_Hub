  Extract-Protocol: 'Nuclei were isolated and digested with DPNII overnight. T4 ligase
    was added in dilute conditions (10ml) and incubated at 16C for 4-6hrs.

    Libraries were prepared by the University of Michigan Seqcore.'
  Growth-Protocol: Long day 2-3 weeks
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana
  Source: Seedlings
  Treatment-Protocol: Formaldehyde crosslinking.

Data-Processing: 'Alignment was done by bowtie for each end separately keeping only
  unique matches. Mapped reads were then paired.

  Alignment was done by tophat2 for rna-seq samples and processed by edgeR.
