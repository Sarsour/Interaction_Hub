  - Sau3AI
  Extract-Protocol: 'Cells were lysed using glass beads and chromatin was extracted,
    digested using restriction enzyme Sau3AI or HindIII, gap-filled in using biotinylated
    dCTP, and ligated. Crosslinks were reversed and DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform
    extraction.

    Libraries were prepared according to manufacturer''s instructions using the KAPA
    Hyper Prep kit.'
  Growth-Protocol: Cells were grown overnight, shaking at 30C (room temperature for
    S. uvarum) in YPD media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose), or for "raffinose"
    cultures, YP + 2% raffinose, or for "galactose" cultures, YP + 2% galactose. For
    non-saturated cultures, fresh cultures were inoculated to OD600=0.1 in the same
    media and grown until OD600 = 0.6-0.8.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Saccharomyces paradoxus x Saccharomyces uvarum
  Source: Cells
  Treatment-Protocol: Cells were crosslinked by resuspension and incubation in 1%
    formaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature, and then quenched by addition
    of 1% solid glycine, incubation for 20 minutes, and a PBS wash. For nocodazole
    culture, media was supplemented with 15 ug/ml nocodazole and grown for an additional
    2 hours prior to crosslinking.

Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C-seq\nBasecalls were converted to FASTQ using\
  \ bcl2fastq 2.17\nSequencing reads were quality-trimmed (cutadapt -q 20) trimmed\
  \ of adapter sequences and then trimmed up to the ligation junction (if present),\
  \ excluding read pairs in which either read was shorter than 20 bp after trimming.\n\
  Reads were independently mapped using bowtie2 2.2.3 using the parameter set --very-sensitive.\
  \ For interspecific hybrids, reads were mapped to a combined reference containing\
  \ both species references, where if secondary mappings were present the best alignment\
  \ must have a score \u2265 10 greater than the next best alignment. For intraspecific\
  \ S. cerevisiae hybrids, reads were mapped separately to both strain references,\
  \ keeping only read pairs mapping to both\u2014perfectly to one reference and with\
  \ \u2265 2 mutations including \u2265 1 substitution to the other. In both cases,\
  \ only read pairs in which both reads mapped with MAPQ \u2265 30 were used.\nPCR\
  \ duplicates (with identical fragment start and end positions) were removed, as\
  \ were read pairs mapping within 1 kb of each other or in the same restriction fragment,\
  \ which represent either unligated or invalid ligation products.\nThe genome was\
  \ then binned into 32 kb fragments (except the last fragment of each chromosome),\
  \ and the number of read pairs mapping to each 32 kb genomic bin was counted based\
  \ on the position of the restriction sites that were ligated together. Due to gaps\
  \ in the reference genomes of S. uvarum, some repetitive sequences were only represented\
  \ once and therefore artifactually mapped uniquely; therefore, reads mapping to\
  \ annotated repetitive sequences were masked from further analysis. Similarly, gaps\
  \ in the S. paradoxus reference led to mismapping of reads to the corresponding\
  \ S. cerevisiae sequence; therefore, for S. cerevisiae x S. paradoxus libraries\
  \ we masked regions in the S. cerevisiae genome where > 1 read from a S. paradoxus\
  \ Hi-C library mapped, and vice versa. We took a similar approach to mask regions\
  \ of the Y12 and DBVPG6044 references that were prone to mismapping, as estimated\
  \ by haploid Y12 and DBVPG6044 Hi-C libraries. For knock-in experiments, the HAS1pr-TDA1pr\
  \ region was masked to account for its altered genomic location. The resulting matrices\
  \ were then normalized by excluding the diagonal (interactions within the same genomic\
  \ bin), filtering out rows/columns with an average of less than 1 read per bin,\
  \ and then multiplying each entry by the total number of read pairs divided by the\
  \ column and row sums.\nGenome_build: Saccharomyces cerevisiae R64.2.1 from SGD\
  \ and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum (bayanus var. uvarum) from\
  \ saccharomycessensustricto.org, with minor modifications; Y12 and DBVPG6044 references\
  \ generated by Pacbio sequencing\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content: tab-delimited\
  \ text files ending in \"matrix.txt\" include the raw read counts and normalized\
  \ interaction frequencies for each pair of 32 kb genomic bins; those ending in \"\
  rowsums.txt\" include the raw sums across each row of these matrices. BED files\
  \ include either the genomic regions included in each matrix bin or those masked\
  \ from the matrices."
