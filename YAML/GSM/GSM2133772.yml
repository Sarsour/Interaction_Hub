  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room\
    \ temperature and quenched with glycine. Nuclear lysates were digested with DpnII\
    \ or Hinf1 and  fragment ends were filled with biotinylated nucleotides prior\
    \ to ligatation. Ligated fragments were reverse crosslinked, purified, and sonicated\
    \ prior to generation of Illumina libraries.\nLibraries were constructed using\
    \ the standard protocol. Genomic fragments were end repaired (NEBNext End Repair\
    \ Module), A-tailed by adding  adenosine to  the 3\u2019 ends of fragment using\
    \ Klenow fragment (3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exo minus, New England Biolabs), and adaptors\
    \ were ligated at room temperature for 1 hr with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs).\
    \ Libraries were amplified with Illumina primers using the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR\
    \ Master Mix."

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: Hi-C

  Raw HiC data from this submission and the four normal temperature HiC biological
  replicates digested with DpnII from GSE63515 (GSM1551441, GSM1551442, GSM1551443,
  GSM1551444) were combined and processed through the Juicer pipeline (Rao et al.
  2014. Cell. 159:1665-80) to generate the .hic file.

  To identify the significant genomic interactions, the .hic file was further processed
  through ICE and Fit-Hi-C (Imakaev, et al. 2012. Nature. 9:999-1003; Ay et al. 2014.
  Genome Research. 24:999-1011)

  Genome_build: dm6

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The .hic file contains the HiC contact matrix.
  The Fithic .txt file contains the genomic coordinates of the interactions anchors
  in columns 1-3 and 4-6. The p value and q value for each interaction are reported
  in column 7 and 8, respectively.'
