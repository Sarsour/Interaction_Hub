  Characteristics: NSC iPS p3
  Extract-Protocol: 'Cells are cross linked using 2% formaldehyde for 10min at room
    temperature in PBS 10%FCS, nuclei are isolated, after which chromatin is digested
    with DpnII subsequently ligated. After reversal of the cross links the DNA is
    purified (3C template).

    The 3C template is fragmented and TruSeq libraries are prepared according to the
    vendor protocol.'
  Growth-Protocol: "ESCs and iPSCs were cultured on Mitomycin-C treated MEFs in KO-DMEM\
    \ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1\
    \ mM \u03B2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), 1,000 U/ml LIF (Millipore) and 15% fetal\
    \ bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) (ESC medium). Na\xEFve ESCs were cultured in\
    \ serum-free N2B27 medium on gelatin-coated dishes. N2B27 medium (500ml) was generated\
    \ by inclusion of the following: 240ml DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), 240ml Neurobasal\
    \ (Invitrogen), 5ml N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 10ml B27 supplement (Invitrogen),\
    \ 1,000 U/ml LIF (Millipore), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1mM\
    \ \u03B2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and the small molecules PD0325901 (Stemgent,\
    \ 1\u03BCM) and CHIR (Stemgent, 3\u03BCM). CD19 + pre-B cells and Mac1 + macrophages\
    \ were isolated from bone marrow with monoclonal antibodies to CD19 and Mac-1\
    \ (BD Pharmingen) respectively, using MACS sorting (Miltenyi Biotech). B cells\
    \ were grown in RPMI medium with 10% FBS and 10ng/ml IL-7 (Peprotech); macrophages\
    \ in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10ng/ml each of CSF1 and IL-3 (Peprotech). MEFs were\
    \ established from day 13.5 mouseembryos and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS.\
    \ NSC were isolated and cultured aspreviously described (Di Stefano et al., 2009).\
    \ All media were supplemented with L-glutamineand penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO).\n\
    Reprogramming experiments with B cells were performed as previously described\
    \ (Di Stefano et al., 2014); with MEFs, macrophages and NSCs were conducted by\
    \ plating 100.000 cells/well on gelatinized plates seeded with irradiated MEFs,\
    \ using ESC medium supplemented with 2 \u03BCg/ml of doxycycline. For the isolation\
    \ of iPSC lines, doxycycline was washed out after 15 days of reprogramming and\
    \ colonies with ESC-like morphology were picked at 20 days before further passaging.\
    \ iPSC lines were expanded for an additional 9 days (3 passages) to obtain P3\
    \ iPS cell lines or for 20 passages to obtain P20 iPS cell lines."

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: HiC

  Forward and reverse (R1,R2) sequencing files are seperately aligned to the mouse
  genome (mm9) using bwa mem. Duplicates are removed and mapped pairs are filtered
  using the hicup_filter from the HiCUP package. Pairs that fall within 1kb of each
  other are removed from the sample as they likely represent non-cut genomic DNA fragments.

  Genome_build: mm9

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Hi-C summary files contain the genomic position
  and strand of the two pairs of a Hi-C ligation'
