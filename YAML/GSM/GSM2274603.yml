  Extract-Protocol: "On day 8 post-infection (p.i.), CD45.2+CD8+KLRG1+ IL-7Ra\u2013\
    \ cells were sort-purified as terminally differentiated effector CD8+ T cells.\
    \ On \u2265 day 60 p.i., CD45.2+CD8+CD62L+ cells were purified as central memory\
    \ CD8+ T cells. From the lymph nodes of uninfected P14 TCR-Tg mice, CD62L+CD44lo-med\
    \ CD8+ cells were isolated as na\xEFve CD8+ T cells. The cell sorting was performed\
    \ on on FACSAria (BD Biosciences).\nFive million CD62L+CD44lo na\xEFve CD8 T cells\
    \ were sort-purified from WT mice and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\
    \ min at room temperature. The nuclei were then permeabilized and DNA digested\
    \ with 100 units of MboI restriction enzyme. The ends of restriction fragments\
    \ were labeled using biotinylated nucleotides followed by ligation. After reversal\
    \ of crosslinks, the ligated DNA was purified and sheared to 300-500 bps in length.\
    \ The ligation junctions were pulled down with streptavidin beads and sequenced"
  Growth-Protocol: "Naive CD45.2+ P14 TCR-Tg CD8+ T cells were isolated from the lymph\
    \ nodes and adoptively transferred into CD45.1+ na\xEFve recipient mice at 10,000\
    \ cells per mouse. One day later, the recipient mice were i.p. infected with 2\xD7\
    105 PFU of LCMV-Armstrong."
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Mus musculus
  Source: CD8 T cell
  Treatment-Protocol: C57BL/6 and B6.SJL mice were from the Jackson Laboratory. All
    mouse experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional
    Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Iowa.

Data-Processing: 'Basecalls performed using Illumina Casava version 1.8

  Reads were mapped to mouse genome (mm9) using Bowtie2. Only uniquely mapped reads
  with fewer than 2 mismatches were used for downstream analyses.

  Contact matrices are built and ICE normalization are performed using HiC-Pro_v2.7
  pipeline.
