  Extract-Protocol: "5-10 million Haploid mouse ES cells were fixed for 5 min with\
    \ 2 % formaldehyde in PBS and then the reaction was quenched for another 5 min\
    \ in 0.125 M glycine. Nuclei were then extracted by incubating cells on ice for\
    \ 30 min (inverting every 10 min) in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2 % NP-40\
    \ (IGEPAL CA-630) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).\nPopulation Hi-C libraries\
    \ were prepared as follows. Briefly, sonicated DNA was end-repaired using a combination\
    \ of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and\
    \ T4 polynucleotide kinase. Biotinylated junctions were captured on streptavidin\
    \ M-280 dynabeads and the blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow\
    \ fragment  exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation\
    \ of custom adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3\u2019 end.\
    \ After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 10 cycles\
    \ and library fragments of ~300-700 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences)\
    \ were isolated using AMPure beads (Beckman). The purified DNA was captured on\
    \ an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the\
    \ HiSeq2500 following the manufacturer's protocols."
  Growth-Protocol: 'All mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were cultured on 0.2 %
    gelatin in 2i media (NDiff B27 base medium, Stem Cell Sciences Ltd, catalogue
    no: SCS-SF-NB-02, supplemented with 1 uM PD0325901, 3 uM CHIR99021 and 20 ng/ml
    LIF). Haploid mESCs were sorted every 4 passages to enrich for haploid cells as
    previously described in Leeb M & Wutz A, Nature, 2011'

  Basecalls performed using Phred quality score (Q score)

  ChIP-seq reads were aligend to the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome reference using Bowtie
  2 v2.1.050 and filtered to retain reads with mapping quality >30.

  ChIP-seq peaks were called using MACS2 v2.1.0.2015073157 with a minimum FDR cutoff
  of 0.01 (-q 0.01), except for broad features (H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3) where
  a cutoff of 0.05 was used (-q 0.05).

  ChIP-seq peaks were filtered to remove those not corresponding to the canonical
  chromosomes.

  RNA-seq transcript abundance estimates for all annotated mouse transcripts (Ensembl
  v71, GRCm38/mm10) and ERCC spike-in sequences were obtained using Kallisto v0.42.4
  (arXiv:1505.02710).

  RNA-seq gene-level abundances were summarized from transcript-level estimates using
  the tximport R package.

  Population Hi-C reads were processed using the HiCUP software package (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/overview/).
  Processed reads were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome reference using Bowtie
  2 and filtered to retain reads that formed a valid Hi-C contact junction between
  two RE1 resriction sites.

  Single cell Hi-C reads were initially processed using the NucProcessing software
  package (available upon request). Processed reads were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10
  mouse genome reference using Bowtie 2 and filtered to retain reads that formed a
  valid Hi-C contact junction between two RE1 resriction sites. Output files were
  further processed to perform extra, single-cell specific processing and cleanup.
  These remove any pairs that represent only a single observation of a specific RE1-RE1
  ligation junction after PCR amplification, while at least two separate, albeit sometimes
  identical, molecules must be paired-end sequenced to confirm a ligation junction.
  Next the sequence pairs were filtered to remove those with promiscuous ends: where
  the RE1 fragment at either end was involved in more than one ligation event. Finally,
  the redundancy in amplified RE1-RE1 ligation events was removed to create a single
  list of paired RE1 fragment ends.
