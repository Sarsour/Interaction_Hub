  Extract-Protocol: "Insect tissue was crosslinked and then lysed with nuclei permeabilized\
    \ but still intact. DNA was then restricted and the overhangs filled in incorporating\
    \ a biotinylated base. Free ends were then ligated together in situ. Crosslinks\
    \ were reversed, the DNA was sheared to 300-500bp and then biotinylated ligation\
    \ junctions were recovered with streptavidin beads.\nStandard Illumina library\
    \ construction protocol. Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of\
    \ T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and\
    \ T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow\
    \ fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for\
    \ ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the\
    \ 3\u2019 end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers\
    \ for 8-12 cycles and library fragments of 400-600 bp (insert plus adaptor and\
    \ PCR primer sequences) were purified using SPRI beads. The purified DNA was captured\
    \ on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on\
    \ the NextSeq500 following the manufacturer's protocols.\nIn situ Hi-C (Rao, Huntley\

Data-Processing: 'The paired end reads were processed against the draft genome assemblies
  using Juicer tool for Hi-C experiments (Durand et al. 2016) to produce merged_nodups.txt
  files, a duplicate-free list of paired alignments of Hi-C reads to the draft fasta.

  The merged_nodups.txt files were used as input into a custom Hi-C assembly pipeline
  (see Dudchenko et al.) to create chromosome-length assembly fasta files.

  The paired end reads were processed against the chromosome-length assemblies using
  Juicer tool for Hi-C experiments (Durand et al. 2016) to create genome-wide Hi-C
  contact maps compatible with Juicebox visualization tool for Hi-C contact maps (hic-files).
  Additional filtration was applied for contact matrices for Samples 2 and 3 (Aedes
  aegypti) to remove contact pairs from poly-G reads.

  Genome_build: Draft genome for Samples 1 and 2 (Aedes aegypti) was downloaded form
  GenBank (accession number GCA_000004015.2). Draft genome for Sample 3 (Culex quinquefasciatus)
  was downloaded from VectorBase (INSDC Assembly GCA_000209185.1). Discovar de novo
  version 52488 was used to create a draft genome for Sample GSM1551550 (GM12878,
  Homo sapiens, see GSE63525) from reads downloaded from Sequence Read Archive SRX297987.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Draft assembly fasta for GSM1551550 (Homo
  sapiens GM12878 sample).

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Merged_nodups.txt files for Samples 1/2,
  3 and GSM1551550 containing duplicate-free lists of of paired alignment of Hi-C
  reads to the draft fastas as generated by the Juicer pipeline (Durand et al., 2016).
  Only the first 100,000,000 read pairs from the data produced for GSM1551550 as part
  of the SGE63525 study was used.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Final assembly fastas for Samples 1/2, 3
  and GSM1551550.
