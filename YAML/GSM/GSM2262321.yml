  Extract-Protocol: 'DNA was purified by PCI extraction and ethanol precipitation,
    treated with RNase A, and ~250-350 bp DNA was gel-purified following 3% agarose
    gel electrophoresis.

    Purified DNA was treated with End-it, subject to A-tailing with Exo- Klenow, and
    ligated to Illumina adaptors. Adaptor-ligated DNA was then purified with streptavidin
    beads to isolate ligated Micro-C products away from undigested dinucleosomal DNA.
    Streptavidin beads were then subject to ~10-13 cycles of PCR using Illumina paired-end
    primers.

    Amplified library was purified and subject to Illumina Nextseq 500 paired end
    sequencing with 40 x 40 bp reads.'
  Growth-Protocol: The 100mL yeast cultures were grown to midlog phase ~OD 0.55 in
    indicated media at 30 C.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  Source: Yeast
  Treatment-Protocol: '1) Protocol for formaldehyde only: Yeast cells were fixed with
    3% formaldehyde for 15 min and quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were
    pelleted, spheroplasted with Zymolyase, and treated with a level of MNase yielding
    >95% mononucleosomes. 2) Protocol for long crosslinking: Yeast cells were fixed
    with 3% formaldehyde for 10 min, and quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells
    were pelleted and spheroplasted with Zymolyase. The spheroplasts were washed by
    PBS, subjected to long-crosslinker fixation for 40min, and quenched with 250 mM
    glycine for 5 min. Cells were pelleted again, washed with PBS, and treated with
    a level of MNase yielding >95% mononucleosomes. After stopping MNase, chromatin
    pellet and supernatant was dephosphorylated using rSAP separately. Crosslinked
    chromatin was subject to T4 DNA polymerase / T4 PNK enzyme mix solution to generate
    blunt ends. Chromatin was diluted into 2.5 mL and treated with T4 DNA ligase.
    Ligated products were treated with 100U of exonuclease III for 5 min to eliminate
    biotinylated ends of unligated DNA. Proteinase K was then added and incubated
    at 65 C overnight.'
