  Characteristics:
  - GM12878
  - B-lymphoblastoids

  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked and then lysed with nuclei permeabilized\
    \ but still intact.\_DNA was digested with CviJI in CviJI reaction buffer and\
    \ ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The library was enriched for ligation products after\
    \ proximity ligation using size selection on an agarose gel.\_\nStandard Illumina\
    \ library construction protocol was performed, and libraries were sequenced on\
    \ the HiSeq X Ten/NextSeq/HiSeq2500 following the manufacturer's protocols."
  Growth-Protocol: Cell lines were cultured according to manufacturer's instructions

Data-Processing: 'The paired end reads were aligned separately using BWA against the
  b37 (human), mm10 (mouse), or rheMac2 (rhesus macaque).

  PCR duplicates, low mapping quality and unligated reads were removed using an in-house
  Hi-C analysis pipeline (see Rao, Huntley, et al, Cell 2014l)

  Contact matrices were constructed at various resolutions and normalized using an
  in-house Hi-C analysis pipeline (see Rao, Huntley, et al, Cell 2014)

  genome build: b37 (human), mm10 (mouse), rheMac2 (rhesus macaque)

  processed data files format and content: Contact matrices: a text file with the
  raw observed contact matrix in sparse matrix notation at a given resolution. Only
  the upper triangle of the matrix is provided (i.e. i<=j), the matrix is symmetric,
  so M_i,j = M_j,i. At this stage of processing, read pairs where one or both ends
  do not align to the reference genome have already been removed, as well as chimeric
  ambiguous reads (see Section II.a.2 of the Extended Experimental Procedures of Rao,
  Huntley, et al., Cell 2014 for a definition of chimeric ambiguous reads). In addition,
  duplicate reads (reads where both ends align to within +/- 4bp of each other) have
  been removed as well (see Section II.a.3 of the Extended Experimental Procedures
  of Rao, Huntley, et al., Cell 2014 for a full description of duplicate removal).
  Full details of the Hi-C processing pipeline used in this study are provided in
  Section II.a. of the Extended Experimental Procedures of Rao, Huntley, et al., Cell
  2014.

  processed data files format and content: Normalization files: normalization vectors
  that can be used to transform the raw contact matrices M into normalized matrices
  M*.  Each file is ordered such that the first line of the normalization vector file
  is the norm factor for the first row/column of the corresponding raw contact matrix,
  the second line is the factor for the second row/column of the contact matrix, and
  so on. To normalize, an entry M_i,j in a *RAWobserved file, divide the entry by
  the corresponding norm factors for i and j. (See section II.b of the Extended Experimental
  Procedures of Rao, Huntley, et al., Cell, 2014 for more information about the different
  types of normalizations.)

  processed data files format and content: HiCCUPS_looplist.txt files contain loop
  calls generated via HiCCUPS; first three fields represent the locus participating
  in the loop closer to the p-end of the chromosome; fields 4-6 represent the locus
  participating in the loop closer to the q-end of the chromosome; field 7 represents
  the color used to display the feature in Juicebox (a Hi-C data visualization software,
  see www.aidenlab.org/juicebox); field 8 represents the observed number of counts
  at the loop; fields 9-12 represent the expected number of counts at the loop using
  four different expected models; fields 13-16 are the q-values over each of the expected
  values; field 17 is the number of enriched pixels that was clustered into a particular
  loop; field 18-19 are the centroid of the loop; field 20 is the radius of the loop

  processed data files format and content: Arrowhead_domainlist.txt files contain
  domain calls generated via Arrowhead; first 6 fields represent the boundaries of
  the domain; field 7 represents the color used to display the feature in Juicebox
  (a Hi-C data visualization software, see www.aidenlab.org/juicebox); field 8 is
  the corner score for the domain (see Rao, Huntley, et al); fields 9-12 are the component
  scores used in the Arrowhead algorithm (see Rao, Huntley, et al)

  processed data files format and content: merged_nodups.txt files contain filtered,
  "normal" contacts. Each line represents a single Hi-C read pair that has passed
  the alignment and duplicate removal stages. The format of each line of the file
  is: read_name, strand1, chromosome1, position1, fragment-index1, strand2, chromosome2
  ,position2, fragment-index2, mapq1, mapq2

  processed data files format and content: collisions.txt.gz files contain the contacts
  that have 3 or more loci.'
