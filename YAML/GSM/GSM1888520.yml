  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min, and the reaction\
    \ was quenched by the addition of ice-cold glycine (0.125 M final concentration).\
    \ After centrifugation (400xg, 10 min), cells were washed with PBS, spun down\
    \ (400xg, 10 min), the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was flash-frozen\
    \ in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u02DAC. Cell pellets were incubated in\
    \ 50 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA-630,\
    \ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) for 30 min on ice, followed by a centrifugation\
    \ to pellet cell nuclei (650xg, 5 min). Nuclei were resuspended in 1.25x NEBuffer\
    \ 2, SDS was added (0.3% final concentration), and nuclei were incubated at 37\u02DA\
    C and 950 rpm (shaking) for one hour. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration\
    \ 1.7%, and nuclei were incubated at 37\u02DAC and 950 rpm (shaking) for one hour.\
    \ After digestion with HindIII (NEB; 1500 units per 5 million cells) overnight\
    \ at 37\u02DAC and 950rpm (shaking), restriction sites were filled in with Klenow\
    \ (NEB) using biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies), dCTP, dGTP and dTTP (all at\
    \ a final concentration of 30 \xB5M) for 60 min at 37\u02DAC. After addition of\
    \ SDS (1.42% final concentration) and incubation at 65\u02DAC and 950rpm (shaking)\
    \ for 25 min, ligation was performed for four hours at 16\u02DAC (50 units T4\
    \ DNA ligase (Life Technologies) per 5 million cells starting material) in a total\
    \ volume of 8.2 ml ligation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1mM ATP, 10 mM\
    \ DTT, 100 ug/ml BSA, 0.9% Triton X-100). The reversal of crosslinks (65\u02DA\
    C overnight in the presence of Proteinase K), was followed by RNase A treatment\
    \ and two sequential phenol chloroform extractions of DNA.\nThe concentration\
    \ DNA was determined using Quant-iT Pico Green (Life Technologies), and 40 \xB5\
    g of Hi-C library DNA were subjected to removal of biotin (T4 DNA polymerase (NEB),\
    \ 4 hours at 20\u02DAC) from non-ligated fragment ends, followed by DNA purification\
    \ (Qiagen PCR purification kit) and sonication (Covaris E220). Sonicated DNA was\
    \ end-repaired (T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase, Klenow (all NEB)),\
    \ and a double size selection using AMPure XP beads (ratio SPRI beads solution\
    \ volume to sample volume to 0.6:1, then 0.9:1) was performed, before dATP-addition\
    \ with Klenow exo- (NEB). Biotin-marked ligation products were isolated using\
    \ MyOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads (Life Technologies) in binding buffer (5 mM\
    \ Tris pH8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by\
    \ two washes in binding buffer, and one wash in ligation buffer (NEB). PE adapters\
    \ (Illumina) were ligated onto Hi-C ligation products bound to streptavidin beads\
    \ for 2 hours at room temperature (T4 DNA ligase NEB, in ligation buffer, slowly\
    \ rotating). After washes in wash buffer (5 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05%\
    \ Tween-20) and binding buffer, the DNA-bound beads were resuspended in a final\
    \ volume of 30 \xB5l NEBuffer 2. Bead-bound Hi-C DNA was amplified with 6 to 8\
    \ PCR amplification cycles using PE PCR 1.0 and PE PCR 2.0 primers (Illumina).\
    \ The concentration and size distribution of Hi-C library DNA after PCR amplification\
    \ was determined by Bioanalyzer profiles (Agilent Technologies).  Bait capture\
    \ system design for Promoter Capture Hi-C A list of transcripts was obtained from\
    \ the Ensembl BioMart system, detailing the positions and assigned biotype for\
    \ all transcripts in their gene build. The list was filtered to keep only transcripts\
    \ with a biotype of protein-coding, non-coding (lincRNA), antisense, snRNA, miRNA\
    \ or snoRNA. A genomic restriction map was then created to generate a list of\
    \ all HindIII fragments in the genome, and this was subsequently filtered against\
    \ the transcript list to keep only restriction fragments which contained the transcriptional\
    \ start position for one or more transcripts. For each restriction fragment containing\
    \ a transcription start site, two 120 bp capture probes were designed, one to\
    \ each end of the fragment. Because of the size selection step following sonication,\
    \ the probes had to fall entirely within a region no more than 500 bp from the\
    \ end of the fragment. Each probe was required to have no more than 3 consecutive\
    \ bases masked by repeatmasker, and they had to have a GC content of 25 to 65%\
    \ to match the efficient capture range of the SureSelect target enrichment system\
    \ (Agilent Technologies). Where multiple probes passed these criteria, the probe\
    \ nearest the end of the restriction fragment was chosen."
