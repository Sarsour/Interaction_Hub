  Characteristics:
  - "TNF-\u03B1 (10ng/mL) 1hr"
  - Hi-C
  - 'no'
  - HindIII
  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were conducted in biological replicates using
    HindIII according to previous publication (Lieberman-Aiden, E. et al. Comprehensive
    mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.
    Science 326, 289-93 (2009).).  ChIP-seq protocol can be found from http://bioinformatics-renlab.ucsd.edu/RenLabLibraryProtocolV1.pdf.
    GRO-seq experiments were performed according to previous publication (Wang, D.
    et al. Reprogramming transcription by distinct classes of enhancers functionally
    defined by eRNA. Nature 474, 390-4 (2011).).

    Libraries were prepared according to Illumina''s instruction or cited literatures.'
  Growth-Protocol: "IMR90 cells were grown as described in (Hawkins, R.D. et al. Cell\
    \ Stem Cell 6, 479-91). MCF7 cells (ATCC), LNCaP cells (ATCC), and Human primary\
    \ HUVEC cells (Lonza) were cultured following manufacturer\u2019s instructions."
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Homo sapiens
  Source: fetal lung fibroblast
  Treatment-Protocol: "TNF-a (R&D Systems, 10 ng/mL, 1 hr) treatment were performed\
    \ in IMR90 or HUVEC cells.  Flavopiridol (Sigma, 1 \u03BCM for 1 hr) and IFN-\u03B3\
    \ (R&D, 50ng/mL for 2hrs) were performed in IMR90 cells. To find out primary TNF-\u03B1\
    \ responsive genes, IMR90 cells were pre-treated with 5\xB5g/mL of cycloheximide\
    \ (sigma) for 30mins before TNF-\u03B1 was added. Starvation and treatment of\
    \ MCF7 cells with \u03B2-estradiol (Sigma, 100nM for 160min) were performed as\
    \ described in previous literature (Hah, N. et al. Cell 145, 622-634, 2011); and\
    \ LNCaP cells were starved and treated with 5\u03B1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT,\
    \ 100nM, 4hr) as previously described(Wang, D. et al. Nature 474, 390-394, 2011)"

Data-Processing: 'The paired-end Hi-C reads were mapped to human genome hg18 using
  BOWTIE. Only first 36 bases were used for mapping when reads is longer. The two
  reads were mapped independently and then merged into pairs using in-house script.
  Duplicated read pairs from the same biological library were removed.

  For GRO-seq, the first round of mapping used the first 36 bases; the unmapped reads
  were then mapped in two additional iterations using first 30 or 25 bases.

  For ChIP-Seq, first 36 bases of each read were used for mapping.

  RNA-seq data were analyzed using TOPHAT and CUFFLINK packages.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Mapped non-redundant reads for RNA-seq,
  GRO-seq and ChIP-seq are in BED format. Mapped non-redundant read pairs for Hi-C
  are in txt format.'
