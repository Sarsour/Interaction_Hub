Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - embryonic stem cells
  - NcoI
  Extract-Protocol: Hi-C libraries were generated as previously published (Lieberman-Aiden
    et al, 2009), with modifications to increase DNA yield. See associated publication
    for details.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Mus musculus
  Source: Mouse 46C ES cells

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: Hi-C

  The paired end Hi-C reads were mapped and filtered with the hiclib pipeline (Imakaev
  et al., 2012, Downloaded November 2013) using default parameters. Data was binned
  at 50kb or 100kb, depending on the application.

  Hi-C matrices were corrected using Iterative Correction (Imakaev et al., 2012) and
  further processed with custom code to generate normalized heatmaps (See associated
  publication for details).

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed data files are tab-delimited text
  files that contain raw or normalized interaction scores between genomic loci for
  a given chromosome. The coordinates of each loci are marked in the first row and
  first column of the table.'
