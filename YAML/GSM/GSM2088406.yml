  Extract-Protocol: "For Hi-C, cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\
    \ min at room temperature. Crosslinking was quenched with glycine and nuclear\
    \ lysates were incubated with HindIII. Fragment ends were filled with biotinylated\
    \ nucleotides, ligated. After reverssion of crosslinks, DNA was purified, sonicated\
    \ and used to make Illumina libraries.\nLibraries for Illumina sequencing were\
    \ constructed using the following standard protocol. The fragment end were repaired\
    \ using the NEBNext End Repair Module, and adenosine was added at the 3\u2019\
    \ ends of fragment using Klenow fragment (3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exo minus, New England\
    \ Biolabs). Precipitated DNA and input DNA were incubated with adaptors at room\
    \ temperature for 1 hr with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and amplified\
    \ with Illumina primers."

Data-Processing: 'For Hi-C, The paired end Hi-C reads were mapped independently using
  BWA mem and paired. Reads mapping to more than two genomic locations (one for each
  paired end or two for one paired end in agreement with its partner) were discarded.
  Reads were further filtered and normalized using HiFive v1.2.2 (Sauria et al., 2015)
  using the Express algorithm and the settings "--min-interactions 5 --min-distance
  100000 --min-binsize 500 --num-bins 50 --express-iterations 5000 --min-change 0.00005
  --remove-distance --express-reads cis".
