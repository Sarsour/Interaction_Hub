  Extract-Protocol: "Approximately 50 million human ESCs (at passage 56) were harvested\
    \ with Accutase (Life Technologies), suspended in Pluripro media and directly\
    \ processed for fixation. Mouse foetal liver cells were suspended in DMEM (Life\
    \ Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, filtered through a cell strainer (70\
    \ \xB5m) and directly fixed by addition of formaldehyde.\nThirty to 50 million\
    \ cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min, quenched with 0.125 M glycine,\
    \ spun down (400 x g, 5 min) and washed once with PBS. The cells were incubated\
    \ in 50 ml permeabilisation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal\
    \ CA-630, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) for 30 min on\
    \ ice with occasional agitation, spun down (650 x g, 5 min, 4\u02DAC), and the\
    \ cell pellets were resuspended in 358 \xB5l of 1.25 x NEBuffer2 (NEB) per 5 million\
    \ cell aliquot. Eleven \xB5l of 10% SDS was added to each aliquot, followed by\
    \ an incubation at 37\u02DAC for 60 min with continuous agitation (950 rpm). To\
    \ quench the SDS, 75 \xB5l of 10% Triton X-100 was then added per aliquot, followed\
    \ by an incubation at 37\u02DAC for 60 min with continuous agitation (950 rpm).\
    \ To digest chromatin, 1500 U of Hind III (NEB) was added per aliquot and incubated\
    \ at 37\u02DAC overnight with continuous agitation (950 rpm). After digestion,\
    \ restriction sites were filled in with Klenow (NEB) in the presence of biotin-14-dATP\
    \ (Life Technologies), dCTP, dGTP and dTTP (all 30 \xB5M) for 60 min at 37\u02DA\
    C.   For in-solution ligation, 86 \xB5l of 10% SDS was added per aliquot and incubated\
    \ at 65\u02DAC for 30 min with continuous agitation (950 rpm), followed by addition\
    \ of 7.61 ml of ligation mix (745 \xB5l of 10% Triton X-100, 820 \xB5l of 10 x\
    \ T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer [NEB], 82 \xB5l of 10 mg/ml BSA [NEB] and 5.965\
    \ ml water) per aliquot and incubation at 37\u02DAC for 60 min with occasional\
    \ agitation. For in-nucleus ligation, 7.61 ml of ligation mix (820 \xB5l of 10\
    \ x T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer [NEB], 82 \xB5l of 10 mg/ml BSA [NEB] and 6.71\
    \ ml water) was added per aliquot (compared to the in-solution ligation, SDS addition\
    \ and incubation at 65\u02DAC were omitted). For the ligation reaction (both in-solution\
    \ and in-nucleus variants), 50 \xB5l of 1 U/\xB5l T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies)\
    \ was added per aliquot, followed by incubation at 16\u02DAC for 4 hrs.   The\
    \ cross-links were reversed by adding 60 \xB5l of 10 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche)\
    \ per aliquot and incubating at 65\u02DAC overnight. After overnight incubation,\
    \ another 60 \xB5l of proteinase K per aliquot was added, followed by incubation\
    \ at 65\u02DAC for an additional two hours. RNA was removed by adding 12.5 \xB5\
    l of 10 mg/ml RNase A (Roche) per aliquot and incubating at 37\u02DAC for 60 min.\
    \ DNA was isolated by a phenol (Sigma) extraction, followed by a phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol\
    \ (Sigma) extraction and standard ethanol precipitation. The precipitated DNA\
    \ was washed three times with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 25 \xB5l TE per aliquot.\
    \ Subsequently all aliquots were pooled and the Hi-C DNA was quantified (Quant-iT\
    \ Pico Green, Life Technologies). Biotin was removed from non-ligated restriction\
    \ fragment ends by incubating 30 to 40 \xB5g of Hi-C library DNA with T4 DNA polymerase\
    \ (NEB) for 4 hours at 20\u02DAC in the presence of dATP. After DNA purification\
    \ (Qiagen PCR purification kit) and sonication (Covaris E220), the sonicated DNA\
    \ was end-repaired with T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase, Klenow\
    \ (all NEB) and dNTPs in 1 x T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer (NEB). Double size\
    \ selection of DNA was performed using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), before\
    \ dATP-addition with Klenow exo- (NEB). Biotin-marked ligation products were isolated\
    \ with MyOne Streptavidin C1 Dynabeads (Life Technologies) in binding buffer (5\
    \ mM Tris pH8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature, followed\
    \ by two washes in binding buffer, and one wash in 1 x T4 DNA ligase reaction\
    \ buffer (NEB). PE adapters (Illumina) were ligated onto Hi-C ligation products\
    \ bound to streptavidin beads for 2 hours at room temperature (T4 DNA ligase in\
    \ 1 x T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer [NEB], slowly rotating). After washes in wash\
    \ buffer (5 mM Tris, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) and binding buffer,\
    \ the DNA-bound beads were resuspended in NEBuffer 2. Bead-bound Hi-C DNA was\
    \ amplified with 12 PCR amplification cycles using PE PCR 1.0 and PE PCR 2.0 primers\
    \ (Illumina). The concentration and size distribution of Hi-C library DNA after\
    \ PCR amplification was determined by Bioanalyzer profiles (Agilent Technologies)\
    \ and quantitative PCR, and the Hi-C libraries were paired-end sequenced on Illumina\
    \ Hi-Seq1000 or MiSeq platforms."
  Growth-Protocol: H9 (WA09; WiCell) human ESCs were maintained using Pluripro fully-defined
    media and matrix (Cell Guidance Systems). Mouse foetal livers were dissected from
    C57BL/6 mouse embryos at day 14.5 (E14.5) of development.
