Accession: GSM1632602
Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - G1-arrested cells
  - IsceI site 33kb from oriC  and Isce-encoding gene at van locus
  - BglII
  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were performed using BglII restriction enzyme
    according to previous publications (Le et al., 2013 PMID: 24158908)

    Standard library construction for Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing platform'
  Growth-Protocol: 'Caulobacter crescentus were grown as described previously in Skerker
    et al., 2005 (PMID: 16176121). When appropriate, media were supplemented with
    antibiotics at the following concentrations (liquid/solid media) [ug/ml]): chloramphenicol
    (1/2), kanamycin (5/25), oxytetracycline (1/2), spectinomycin (25/100). Synchronizations
    were performed on mid-exponential phase cells using Percoll (GE Healthcare) and
    density gradient centrifugation as described previously in Jones et al., 2001
    (PMID: 11283290).'
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Caulobacter crescentus NA1000
  Source: C. crecentus_vanillate
  Treatment-Protocol: "Caulobacter cells were depleted of DnaA for 1.5 h before synchronization.\
    \ Swarmer cells were then released into DnaA depleting conditions (without IPTG)\
    \ and double-strand breaks were induced for 1 h by the addition of 500 \u03BC\
    M vanillate."

Data-Processing: 'library strategy: chromosome conformation capture coupled with deep
  sequencing (Hi-C)

  Reads from each end of a DNA fragment were represented in each of the two FASTQ
  files generated by Illumina paired-end sequencing.

  We mapped reads in each FASTQ file back to the genome of Caulobacter CB15N (NA1000)
  independently by Bowtie version 2. All the processing steps afterwards were performed
  using public-availabe scripts as reported previously in Le et al., 2013 (PMID: 24158908)
  and in Imakaev et al., 2012 (PMID: 22941365)
