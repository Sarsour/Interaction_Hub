  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were thawed on ice and re-suspended in 50ml freshly prepared\
    \ ice-cold lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10mM NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA-630, one\
    \ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet). Routinely, two pellets from each cell line\
    \ were re-suspended and combined in 7ml complete lysis buffer to give ~50-60million\
    \ cells. Cells were lysed on ice for a total of 30 min, with 2x10 strokes of a\
    \ Dounce homogeniser with a 5 minute break between Douncing. Following lysis,\
    \ the nuclei were pelleted and washed with 1.25xNEB Buffer 2 then re-suspended\
    \ in 1.25xNEB Buffer 2 to make aliquots of 5-6million cells for digestion. Following\
    \ lysis, Hi-C libraries were digested using HindIII then prepared as described\
    \ in van Berkum et al with modifications described in Dryden et al.\nPre-Capture\
    \ amplification was performed with 8 cycles of PCR on multiple parallel reactions\
    \ from Hi-C libraries immobilised on Streptavidin beads which were pooled post-PCR\
    \ and SPRI bead purified. The final library was re-suspended in 30\xB5l TLE and\
    \ the quality and quantity assessed by Bioanalyzer and qPCR. Hi-C samples corresponding\
    \ to 750ng were concentrated in a Speedvac then re-suspended in 3.4\u03BCl water.\
    \ Hybridisation of SureSelect custom promoter and region capture libraries to\
    \ Hi-C libraries was carried out using Agilent SureSelectXT reagents and protocols.\
    \ Post-capture amplification was carried out using 6 cycles of PCR from streptavidin\
    \ beads in multiple parallel reactions, then pooled and purified using SPRI beads."
  Growth-Protocol: GM12878 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640/20 mM L-glutamine supplemented
    with 15% fetal bovine serum in 25cm2 vented culture flasks at 37C/5% CO2
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Homo sapiens
  Source: GM12878 Lymphoblastoid cells
  Treatment-Protocol: Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature,
    followed by the addition of cold 1M glycine to a final concentration of 0.125M
    for 5 minutes at room temperature, then by 15 minutes on ice.

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: Hi-C

  Casava software (v1.8, Illumina) was used to make base calls.

  reads failing Illumina filters were removed before further analysis

  Sequences were output in FASTQ format, poor quality reads truncated or removed as
  necessary, using Trimmomatic version 0.3023, and subsequently mapped to the human
  reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) and filtered to remove experimental artefacts using
  the Hi-C User Pipeline (HiCUP, http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/).

  Off-target di-tags, where neither end mapped to a targeted fragment, were removed
  from the final data sets using a combination of BEDTools and command line tools.
