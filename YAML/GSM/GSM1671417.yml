  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were performed using HindIII  according to previous
    publications (Le et al, 2013, PMID: 24158908).

    Standard library construction for Illumina Hiseq2500 sequencing platform. Illumina
    Truseq indexes were used.'
  Growth-Protocol: 'Bacillus subtilis strains were derived from the prototrophic strain
    PY79 (Youngman et al 1983, PMID: 6300908). Cells were grown in defined rich medium
    (CH) (Harwood and Cutting 1990, Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus ) or
    minimal medium (S750) (Grossman and Losick, 1988, PMID:3132711) supplemented with
    1% sorbitol. Sporulation was induced by resuspension according to the method of
    Sterlini-Mandelstam (Harwood and Cutting 1990, Molecular Biological Methods for
    Bacillus). For Hi-C experiments during sporulation, strains contained a mutant
    of the SpoIIIE DNA translocase (spoIIIE36) that engages the chromosome after polar
    division but does not transport DNA (Wu and Errington, 1994, PMID: 8160014).'

Data-Processing: 'Reads from each end of a DNA fragment were represented in each of
  the two FASTQ files generated by Illumina paired-end sequencing.

  We mapped reads in each FASTQ file back to the genome of Bacillus subtilis PY79
  (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_022898.1) independently by Bowtie version 2.1.0 to
  preserve the order of reads. All the processing steps afterwards were performed
  using an in-house Perl scripts.

  The two resulting SAM files were then merged together. Unaligned reads were discarded.

  The Bacillus subtilis (PY79) genome was then divided into restriction fragments
  (2398 HindIII fragments). Each aligned read was sorted into its corresponding restriction
  fragment. We inferred that a DNA fragment resulted from non-ligation or self-ligation
  if reads from both ends were from the same restriction fragment; these reads were
  discarded. Only DNA fragments for which the reads came from different restriction
  fragments were retained and used for construction of a Hi-C contact map.

  The genome of Bacillus subtilis (PY79) was then divided into bins 10 kb and the
  remaining reads were allocated to their corresponding bin. We then counted the number
  of fragments having reads with in different bins. A raw Hi-C contact map is the
  matrix of read counts in which each entry, mij, indicates the number of fragments
  with ends mapping to bins i and j. The raw Hi-C contact map/matrix is biased due
  to the uneven distribution of restriction enzyme sites and, to a lesser extent,
  differences in GC content and the mappability of individual reads. We normalized
  raw contact maps using an iterative normalization procedure (Imakaev et al., 2012
  PMID: 22941365). Essentially, we converted the number of interactions, or read counts,
  into Hi-C scores by applying the following equation and iteratively repeating it
  for the resulting contact map after each cycle:  mij =mij * (total reads) / (total
  reads in bin i * total reads in bin j). The iterative procedure was repeated until
  the maximum relative error of the total number of Hi-C scores in a bin was less
  than 10-5. Resulting matrices were normalized so that Hi-C scores for each row and
  column sum to 1. Subsequent analysis and visualization was done using R scripts.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Files ending with .matrix.txt: tab-delimited
  text files of the iteratively-corrected Hi-C contact maps/matrices. Each column
  is a 10kb bin of the Bacillus subtilis PY79 genome (0-10K, 10-20k, 20-30k, etc).
  Each row is a 10kb bin of the Bacillus subtilis PY79 genome (0-10K, 10-20k, 20-30k,
  etc).'
