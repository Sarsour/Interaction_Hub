  Extract-Protocol: "DNA was extracted as described in Wilson, N.K. et al., Blood\
    \ 127, e12\u2013e23 (2016).\nHi-C and PCHi-C libraries were generated as described\
    \  in Wilson, N.K. et al., Blood 127, e12\u2013e23 (2016). For PCHi-C, ligation\
    \ products containing promoter sequences were captured using a custom-made RNA\
    \ capture bait system (SureSelect Target Enrichment, Agilent Technologies) designed\
    \ as previously described in Mifsud, B. et al. Nat. Genet. 47, 598\u2013606 (2015),\
    \ and containing 37,608 biotinylated RNAs targeting 22,076 HindIII restriction\
    \ fragment ends. Libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1000\
    \ machine at the Babraham Institute Sequencing Facility."
  Growth-Protocol: "Human ESC (H9/WA09; obtained from WiCell) were cultured at 37\xB0\
    C in 5% CO2 in air in Pluripro media and matrix (Cell Guidance Systems). ESC were\
    \ routinely verified as mycoplasma-free using a PCR-based assay. ESC were differentiated\
    \ into NEC using a previously described protocol (Rada-Iglesias, A. Nature 470,\
    \ 279\u2013283 (2011)) and samples were harvested on day 7."

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: Hi-C-seq

  Standard Illumina base-calling pipeline.

  PCHi-C/Hi-C reads were mapped and filtered with HiCUP (v0.4.2) and Bowtie(v1.0.0).
  Significant interactions were called with CHiCAGO(v0.1.4). RNA-Seq mapping was performed
  with TopHat (v2.0.8b).
