  Extract-Protocol: "Hi-C:  Hi-C was performed as previously described (Lieberman-Aiden,\
    \ E. et al. Comprehensive Mapping of Long-Range Interactions Reveals Folding Principles\
    \ of the Human Genome. Science 326, 289\u2013293 (2009), Naumova, N. et al. Organization\
    \ of the Mitotic Chromosome. Science 342, 948\u2013953 (2013)). Briefly, Cells\
    \ were lysed and chromatin was digested with HindIII, then digested ends were\
    \ filled in with biotinylated dCTP  and ligated.  After reversing the formaldehyde\
    \ crosslinks by incubation at 65 C  with Proteinase K overnight, unligated biotinylated\
    \ ends were removed by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase.  RNA-Seq:  RNA-Seq was\
    \ peformed as previously described (Gendrel, A.-V. et al. Developmental Dynamics\
    \ and Disease Potential of Random Monoallelic Gene Expression. Dev. Cell 28, 366\u2013\
    380 (2014).).\nHi-C:   The ligation products were fragmented by Covaris sonication\
    \ and then size selected by Ampure fractionation.  The DNA ends were prepared\
    \ for Illumina sequencing adapter ligation by repairing the DNA ends and adding\
    \ an \u2018A\u2019  to each end.  The biotinylated junctions were then pulled\
    \ down using MyOne streptavidin beads. Illumina paired end adapters were ligated\
    \ onto the DNA ends and then the fragments were PCR amplified.   Samples were\
    \ sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 using either a PE50 or PE100 bp read (reads\
    \ were truncated to 50bp during mapping).  RNA-Seq:  RNA-Seq was peformed as previously\
    \ described (Gendrel, A.-V. et al. Developmental Dynamics and Disease Potential\
    \ of Random Monoallelic Gene Expression. Dev. Cell 28, 366\u2013380 (2014).)."
  Growth-Protocol: "The hybrid mouse ES cell line F121.6 (129Sv-Cast/EiJ), a gift\

  Treatment-Protocol: "To generate the boundary region deletion, 5X106 ESCs were transfected\
    \ with 5\xB5g each of two plasmids (pX459) each expressing Cas9 and a chimeric\
    \ guide RNA (gRNA1: CATGTTTGAGCATGGAAACCCGG, chrX:72823838-72823860; gRNA2: GGGTTATGGCGGTCGGTTCCTGG,\
    \ chrX:73025513-73025535). Subcloning of ESC was made by limiting dilution. Cells\
    \ were treated for 24 hours with puromycin. As soon as visible, single colonies\
    \ were picked under a microscope to be screened for deletion by PCR (forward primer:\
    \ CGTAGACGCGGCAGTAGTTT, reverse primer:ACATAAACTCCTTTTCAGGACCA). To identify the\
    \ targeted allele, we performed a PCR using primers (F:CTGTCCAAATGGAGGTGCTT R:C\
    \ CTAGGTCCGCTCTCTATCG) that amplify a 203-bp amplicon specifically on the WT allele,\
    \ which contains a SNP (rs29035891). After amplification, PCR products were gelpurified\
    \ and sequenced using the forward or reverse primer used for PCR. Clones positive\
    \ carrying the deletion were expanded and differentiated into NPC as previously\
    \ described (20) and subcloned by limiting dilution. NPC lines were maintained\
    \ in N2B27 medium supplement with EGF and FGF (10ng/ml each), on 0.1% gelatin-coated\
    \ flasks. Clones carrying the boundary deletion on the inactive X were identified\
    \ by RNA FISH against Xist with the p510 plasmid probe and DNA FISH with a BAC\
    \ hybridizing inside the deleted region (RP23-299L1)."

Data-Processing: "Library strategy: HiC-seq\nHi-C was performed as previously described\
  \ (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009 Science, Belton JM et al., 2012 Methods). Briefly,\
  \ Cells were lysed and chromatin was digested with HindIII, then digested ends were\
  \ filled in with biotinylated dCTP  and ligated.  After reversing the formaldehyde\
  \ crosslinks by incubation at 65 C  with Proteinase K overnight, unligated biotinylated\
  \ ends were removed by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase.  To obtain allele-specific\
  \ Hi-C interaction maps in female ESCs (XacastXa129) and a derived clonal NPC line\
  \ (XacastXi129) (Methods; Extended Data Figure 1) (20), we first constructed an\
  \ allelic genome using the reference mm9 genome and all 19,722,473 SNPs. The allelic\
  \ (Cast and 129) genomes were then combined to create a reference diploid genome\
  \ (consisting of 44 chromosomes; 1-19 X,Y,M). All reads were aligned to the diploid\
  \ genome (as described in ref. (31)), thus allowing for a competitive mapping strategy\
  \ between the two alleles. All reads were trimmed to 50bp and then aligned using\
  \ the novoCraft novoalign (v 3.02.00) software package. Reads were aligned using\
  \ the following options (-r all 5 -R 30 -q 2 -n 50, minimumReadDistance=5). The\
  \ best alignment was selected from the list of the top 5 alignments. The alignment\
  \ was considered unique (allelic), if it\u2019s alignment score was = 5 from the\
  \ 2nd best alignment score (alignment score taken from the ZQ tag). Reads that aligned\
  \ uniquely to an allele were classified as allelic (either Cast or 129) whereas\
  \ reads that aligned to both alleles equally (= 5 distance) were classified as ambiguous\
  \ (AMB) (Extended Data Figure 1d). Uniquely aligned Hi-C interactions between loci\
  \ located on the same chromosome were assigned to a specific parental chromosome\
  \ in cis when at least one of the two reads contained a diagnostic SNP, and the\
  \ other either contained a SNP from the same allele, or mapped to both alleles (32).\
  \ We obtained the following paired-end read counts: For ESC (GUR.2d), a total of\
  \ 401,684,614 interactions could be aligned, 372,272,389 of which were unique (after\
  \ PCR duplicate filter), and 95,650,438 of which could be placed to either the Cast\
  \ or 129 allele (25.69%). For NPC (GEI.72b), a total of 277,440,656 interactions\
  \ could be aligned, 253,254,798 of which were unique (after PCR duplicate filter),\
  \ and 82,323,031 of which could be placed to either the Cast or 129 allele (32.51%).\
  \ For deltaFT NPC (D9B2/B129T3), a total of 229,331,123 interactions could be aligned,\
  \ 222,941,525 of which were unique (after PCR duplicate filter), and 85,331,870\
  \ of which could be placed to either the Cast or 129 allele (38.28%). The difference\
  \ in percent of reads assignable to either allele is likely due to differences in\
  \ the percent of cis interactions found in each sample (biological or technical\
  \ variation). The 82-95 million read depth supported generation of allele-specific\
  \ chromatin interaction maps at multiple resolutions (10 Mb, 2.5 Mb, 1 Mb, 500 kb,\
  \ 250 kb, 100 kb, and 40 kb).\nIterative mapping and error filtering/iterative correction\
  \ (IC) of the chromatin interaction data were performed as previously described\
  \ (12,31)) . IC was performed on the diploid (44 chromosomes) (replicate pooled)\
  \ genome-wide matrix for all resolutions\nHi-C SNP density filter: To remove potential\
  \ biases in the Hi-C data related to the density of SNPs in each bin, we calculated\
  \ the number of SNPs residing in each genomic interval (bin) for all Hi-C bins across\
  \ all bin sizes. We then calculated the median number of SNPs per bin, and produced\
  \ a minimum required SNP density cutoff defined as the (median - 1.5 * IQR). Any\
  \ bins with less SNP than the cutoff were removed from all analyses. The SNP density\
  \ cutoffs used for each bin size were: 40 kb, 43 SNPs; 100 kb, 216 SNPs; 250 kb,\
  \ 776.5 SNPs; 500kb, 1767.25 SNPs. The non SNP density filtered data was only used\
  \ for visualization purposes (figure heatmaps). For all intensive purposes, we refer\
  \ to IC Hi-C as data that has been IC\u2019d and run through the snp-density filter.\n\
  Compartment analysis:  The presence and location of the A/B-compartments were calculated\
  \ as previously described (14) (ref Crane Meyer 2015). Compartments were derived\
  \ from the 250 kb IC Hi-C data for each chromosome separately using the CIS maps\
  \ for each sample / allele (Fig 1). The code used to generate the compartments (PC1\
  \ from PCA analysis) will be publically available on github following publication\
  \ (matrix2compartment.pl). Compartments were generated all default options except\
  \ the (cis alpha) option, set to (-ca 0.005).\nInsulation and Boundary calculation:\
  \  TAD structure (insulation/boundaries) was defined via the insulation method as\
  \ previously described with minor modifications (14). The code used to calculate\
  \ the insulation score will be publically available on github following publication\
  \ (matrix2insulation.pl). Insulation vectors were detected using the following options:\
  \ (-is 480000 -ids 320000 -im iqrMean -nt 0 -ss 160000 -yb 1.5 -nt 0 -bmoe 0). The\
  \ output of the insulation script is a vector of insulation scores, and a list of\
  \ minima along the insulation vector (inferred as TAD boundaries). The TAD boundaries\
  \ were not used in this study.\nRNA-Seq:  RNA-Seq data for the ESC (GUR.2d) and\
  \ NPC (GEI.72b) was obtained from previously published work (20). RNA-Seq data for\
  \ the mutant NPC (D9B2/B129T3) was obtained and processed as previously described\
  \ (20).\nRNA-Seq \u2018Expressed/Escapee\u2019 classification:  The allelic RPKM\
  \ values were derived for each gene by splitting the RPKM value by the 129 ratio.\
  \ 129 RPKM = (RPKM * 129 ratio); Cast RPKM = (RPKM * (1 - 129 ratio)); Any gene\
  \ with an allelic RPKM value = 3 RPMK was classified as being expressed. Any gene\
  \ expressed on the Xi was classified as being an escapee.\nGenome_build: mm9"
