  Extract-Protocol: "Nuclei were fixed in separate drops of M2 (not containing BSA)\
    \ with 2% formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Nuclei were washed through drops of complete\
    \ M2. For zygote experiments without pronuclear extraction, zygotes were treated\
    \ identically to oocytes. Here nuclei were separated into individual wells after\
    \ SDS treatment and kept separate in the subsequent steps of the protocol. After\
    \ fixation, zygotes or single isolated pronuclei were incubated in 9 \u03BCl of\
    \ lysis buffer for at least 15 minutes on ice. Similarly zygotes or pronuclei\
    \ were incubated in 9 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 NEB3 buffer supplemented with 0.6% SDS\
    \ for 2 hours at 37\xB0 with shaking in humidified atmosphere. Then nuclei were\
    \ incubated in 1\xD7 DpnII buffer (NEB) with 1\xD7 BSA and  5 U DpnII (NEB). After\
    \ overnight incubation in a humidified incubator at 37\xB0 the DNA ends were ligated\
    \ in 9 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 5 U T4 DNA ligase (Thermo\
    \ Scientific) and they were incubated at 16\xB0C for 4.5 hours with 50 rpm rotation,\
    \ and then were kept for 30 min at room temperature. DNA from each nucleus was\
    \ amplified using illustra GenomiPhi v2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare)\
    \ or illustra Single Cell GenomiPhi DNA amplification kit according to manufacturer's\
    \ recommendations, but both protocols were modified to include a decrosslinking\
    \ step of an overnight (14-16 hours) incubation at 65\xB0C. After the whole-genome\
    \ amplification procedure, the DNA was purified. 1 \u03BCg (or all available amount,\
    \ if the yield was lower) of DNA was diluted to 500 \u03BCl with sonication buffer\
    \ (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) and was sonicated using Branson\
    \ Sonifier 150 for 20 seconds with power setting 3. The sonicated DNA was purified\
    \ and then submitted for library preparation and sequencing.\nThe library preparation\
    \ was done by the VBCF NGS unit (vbcf.ac.at) following the standard DNA sample\
    \  preparation protocol for Solexa platforms (NEB reagents)."
  Growth-Protocol: "3-4-week-old C57BL/6J females were superovulated by intraperitoneal\
    \ injection of PMSG (pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin; 5 IU, Folligon, Intervet)\
    \ followed by hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin; 5 IU, Chorulon, Intervet) injection\
    \ 48 hours later. Natural matings to C57BL/6J males were set up overnight. Zygotes\
    \ were released from the ampullae and treated with hyaluronidase (Sigma) to remove\
    \ surrounding cumulus cells. For isolation of maternal and paternal nuclei, zygotes\
    \ were pre-incubated in culture medium supplemented with 5 \u03BCg/ml cytochalasin\
    \ B (Sigma) and 1 \u03BCM nocodazole (Sigma) for 15 minutes. The zona pellucida\
    \ of the zygotes was opened and nuclei were extracted one by one. The maternal\
    \ and paternal origin of the nuclei was determined taking size of the nuclei and\
    \ position in relation to second polar body into account."

Data-Processing: 'Base calling was performed by VBCF NGS unit

  Mapping: iterative mapping (see Imakaev et al, 2012) using bowtie2 with increased
  stringency parameters: --score-min -L 0.6,0.2--very-  sensitive

  Read filtering: if two reads map to the same strands, and each side of the read
  is within 500 bp of any side of the other read, we retained only one copy of the
  read.

  Additional filtering: we separated the genome into 500 bp bins. If any two bins
  were interacting more than once, only one interaction was counted. Since each region
  is only present in the single cell up to 4 times (in oocytes), we eliminated all
  500 bp bins that form more than 8 unique interactions with other bins.

  Filtered reads were then binned at different resolutions (we provide files at 200Kb
  resolution) using read start as a read position. No normalization was applied to
  the data.
