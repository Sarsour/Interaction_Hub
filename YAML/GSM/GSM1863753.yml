  Extract-Protocol: "Cross-linked chromatin was released by detergent lysis and Dounce\
    \ homogenization.  Cross-linked proteins were then biotinylated at cysteine residues\
    \ and the DNA digested with DpnII.  Digested chromatin was bound to streptavidin\
    \ beads, thoroughly washed to remove uncross-linked DNA, DNA ends filled in with\
    \ biotin-14-dATP, and free DNA ends ligated together.  DNA-protein cross-links\
    \ were reversed, DNA purified, and biotinylated nucleotides marking unligated\
    \ ends removed\nDNA sheared to a mean size of approximately 200 bp.  DNA was end-repaired\
    \ and adaptor-ligated by following \u201CNEBNext End Prep\u201D and \u201CAdaptor\
    \ Ligation\u201D in the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England\
    \ Biolabs).  The biotinylated DNA was pulled down with streptavidin beads and\
    \ PCR amplified by following \"PCR Amplification\" in the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library\
    \ Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs)."

Data-Processing: "Hi-C reads were aligned to genome dm3 using Bowtie 2.\nAligned reads\
  \ were assigned to DpnII restriction fragments.\nReads mapping to the same restriction\
  \ fragment, separated by less than the library insert size, within 4 bp of a restriction\
  \ site, and duplicate reads were removed.\nExceptionally large (> 100 kb) and small\
  \ (<100 bp) restriction fragments and fragments with the highest 0.5% of counts\
  \ were removed.\nFiltered fragments were assigned to 15 kb or 100 kb genomic bins.\n\
  Further filtering at the bin level removed bins where less than half the bin was\
  \ sequenced, the lowest 1% of bins, and the highest 0.05% of interchromosomal bins.\n\
  The resulting Hi-C heatmaps were normalized using a previously described iterative\
  \ approach (Imakaev, M., Fudenberg, G., McCord, R.P., Naumova, N., Goloborodko,\
  \ A., Lajoie, B.R., Dekker, J., and Mirny, L.A. (2012). Iterative correction of\
  \ Hi-C data reveals hallmarks of chromosome organization. Nat Methods 9, 999\u2013\
  1003).\nAll of the above steps were performed using a previously described pipeline\
