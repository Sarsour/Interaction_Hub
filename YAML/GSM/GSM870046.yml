  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde.  25 million cells\
    \ were used for each Hi-C experiment.  Cells were lysed and chromatin was digested\
    \ with HindIII as described previously (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009 (PMID 19815776)).\
    \  Digested ends were filled in with biotinylated dCTP and then ligated for 4\
    \ hours at 16 C.  After reversing the formaldehyde crosslinks by incubation at\
    \ 65 C with Proteinase K overnight, unligated biotinylated ends were removed by\
    \ 4 hours of incubation with 15 U T4 DNA polymerase at 20 C in the presence of\
    \ a low concentration of nucleotides (25 \xB5M each dNTP).  The DNA was fragmented\
    \ by Covaris sonication to an average size of 200 bp and then the ideal size for\
    \ Illumina sequencing (100-300 bp) was selected by Ampure fractionation (0.9x\
    \ Ampure beads to remove the DNA fragments >300 bp followed by 1.3x Ampure beads\
    \ to isolate the remaining DNA fragments > 100 bp).  The DNA ends were prepared\
    \ for Illumina sequencing adapter ligation by repairing the DNA ends and adding\
    \ an 'A'  to each end.  The biotinylated junctions were then pulled down using\
    \ MyOne streptavidin beads at a ratio of 1 uL beads per ng of biotinylated DNA.\
    \  Illumina paired-end adapters were ligated onto the DNA ends and then the fragments\
    \ were PCR amplified for 11-13 cycles.  Samples were sequenced on an Illumina\
    \ HiSeq instrument using the Paired End 50 bp module."
  Growth-Protocol: A retroviral construct containing 26X I-SceI sites was randomly

  For NovoOutput Files: Sequencing reads from the Hi-C experiment were mapped to all
  possible HindIII fragments in the mouse genome (mm9) using NovoAlign V2.07.11 with
  default parameters.  If a sequence read contained the junction between two ligated
  HindIII sites (indicating that the read had passed into the paired interacting fragment),
  only the sequence upstream of this recognized junction was mapped.

  For Valid Pair files: Paired end reads that mapped to the same restriction fragment
  (representing self-ligated or unligated sequences) were discarded as were redundant
  observations of an identical mapped pair of locations.  Such redundant read pairs
  likely arise from a single interacting fragment pair that was amplified by PCR.  Results
  are presented in four columns: Restriction fragment 1 (from paired end 1) position,
  Restriction fragment 2 (from paired end 2) position, total number of paired reads,
  and total number of unique paired reads.
