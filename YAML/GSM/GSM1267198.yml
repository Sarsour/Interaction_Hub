Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C\nfastq:  Illumina's HiSeq Control Software\n\
  For Hi-C read alignment, we aligned Hi-C reads to the hg18 (human) genome. We masked\
  \ any bases in the genome that were genotyped as SNPs in the H1 genome. These bases\
  \ were masked to \u201CN\u201D in order to reduce reference bias mapping artifacts.\
  \ Hi-C reads were aligned iteratively as single end reads using Novoalign. Specifically,\
  \ for iterative alignment, we first aligned the entire sequencing read to either\
  \ the mouse or human genome. Unmapped reads are then trimmed by 5 base pairs and\
  \ realigned. This process is repeated until the read successfully aligns to the\
  \ genome or until the trimmed read is less than 25 base pairs long.  After iterative\
  \ mapping was finished, read pairs were re-constructed from single reads using an\
  \ in house pipeline.  Unmapped reads were filtered out and PCR duplicate reads were\
  \ removed.  Final alignment files were then processed using the GATK pipeline, specifically\
  \ using Indel Realignment and Variant Recalibration.  A similar pipeline was used\
  \ for alignment of the other high-throughput sequencing datasets without the iterative\
  \ alignment step.\nHaplotypes were generated from the final aligned bam file after\
  \ merging the two biological replicats using the HapCUT algorithm.  The details\
  \ of HapCUT are described previously (Bansal and Bafna, Bioinformatics 24, i153-159,\
  \ 2008).\nGenome_build: hg18\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content: Reads are\
  \ listed in bed format with one line for each sequencing read.  The reads have been\
  \ split by haplotype into the \"A\" and \"B\" (alternatively, \"p1\" and \"p2\"\
  ) alleles according to which haplotype the bases within each sequencing read correspond.\
  \  For paired end Hi-C data, each line lists a single read, and paired infomration\
  \ can be obtained from the read names.  The original fastq files for data other\
  \ than the Hi-C and CTCF ChIP-seq are available in the GSE16256 dataset.\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content:\
  \ The processed haplotypes for the H1 genome (\"H1_haps.vcf\") are available in\
  \ VCF format."
