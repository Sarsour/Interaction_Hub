  Extract-Protocol: "Hi-C experiments were carried out as described (Lieberman-Aiden\
    \ et al., 2009) with some modifications. Cells were lysed then the nuclei were\
    \ treated with 0.1% SDS at 65 degree for 10mins and the SDS was quenched by adding\
    \ Triton X-100 to final 1% concentration. Nuclei was digested in 1XNEB (New England\
    \ Biolaboratory) with 400U of HindIII. Digested DNA was blunted with dATP, dGTP,\
    \ dTTP and biotin labeled dCTP.  DNA wan then ligated and puried. biotin-labled\
    \ ligated DNA was purified with streptavidin beads. Illumina paired-end adaptor\
    \ linkers were ligated to DNA pulled-down and amplified and size selected for\
    \ sequencing.\nLibraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying\
    \ the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303). Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a\
    \ combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase)\
    \ and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with\
    \ Klenow fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base\
    \ for ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at\
    \ the 3\u2019 end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina\
    \ primers for 15 cycles and library fragments of ~300 bp (insert plus adaptor\
    \ and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified\
    \ DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries\
    \ were sequenced on the HiSeq2000 following the manufacturer's protocols. Hi-C\
    \ DNA was ligated with Illumina adaptors and then amplified, purified. ChIP DNAs\
    \ were ligated with six different Illumina index adaptors and amplified, purified."
  Growth-Protocol: Fruit fly embryonic Kc167 cells were grown to confluence in CCM3
    serum-free insect medium (HyClone SH30065.01) at 25oC and collected for Hi-C experiments.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Drosophila melanogaster
  Source: female embryonic cells
  Treatment-Protocol: One hundred million Kc167 cells were suspended in 20ml of CM3
    medium at room temperature mixed with equal volume of 48 degree medium and incubated
    in 37 degree water bath for 20 minutes. Heat shocked cells were then fixed by
    adding 0.6 volume of 4 degree medium contain 2.7% formaldehyde to a final concentration
    of 1%, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped
    by adding 1/10 volumes of 1.25 M glycine solution and incubated for 5 min before
    centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min.

  Hi-C datasets were normalized as described (Yaffe and Tanay, Nature Genetics, 2011)

  base-calling was carried out by HudsonAlpha Genomic Service Center

  Paired reads were aligned to the Drosophila reference genome (Dm3) using Bowtie
  0.12.7 (Langmead et al., 2009)  and filtered to remove any pair with one or two
  ends aligned to multiple locations.
