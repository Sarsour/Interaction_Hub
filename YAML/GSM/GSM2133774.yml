  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room\
    \ temperature.  Crosslinking was quenched with glycine and nuclear lysates were\
    \ incubated with HindIII or DpnII. Fragment ends were filled with biotinylated\
    \ nucleotides, ligated. After reversion of crosslinks, DNA was purified, sonicated\
    \ and used to make Illumina libraries\nTo generate sequencing libraries, ChIP\
    \ DNA was prepared for adaptor ligation by end repair (\u2018End-It DNA End Repair\
    \ Kit\u2019\_ - Epicentre Cat# ER0720) and addition of \u2018A\u2019 base to 3\u2019\
    \ ends (Klenow 3\u2019-5\u2019 exo- NEB Cat# M0212S). Illumina adaptors (Illumina\
    \ Cat# PE-102-1001) were titrated according to prepared DNA ChIP sample concentration,\
    \ and ligated with T4 ligase (NEB Cat# M0202S). Ligated ChIP samples were PCR\
    \ amplified using Illumina primers\_ and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB Cat# F-530L)\
    \ and size selected for 200-300bp by gel extraction."

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: Hi-C

  Raw HiC data from this submission and the four normal temperature HiC biological
  replicates digested with DpnII from GSE63515 (GSM1551441, GSM1551442, GSM1551443,
  GSM1551444) were combined and processed through the Juicer pipeline (Rao et al.
  2014. Cell. 159:1665-80) to generate the .hic file.

  To identify the significant genomic interactions, the .hic file was further processed
  through ICE and Fit-Hi-C (Imakaev, et al. 2012. Nature. 9:999-1003; Ay et al. 2014.
  Genome Research. 24:999-1011)

  Genome_build: dm6

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The .hic file contains the HiC contact matrix.
  The Fithic .txt file contains the genomic coordinates of the interactions anchors
  in columns 1-3 and 4-6. The p value and q value for each interaction are reported
  in column 7 and 8, respectively.'
