  Extract-Protocol: 'After hormone treatment, the medium was replaced by medium containing
    1% formaldehyde and incubated 10 min for cross-linking. The reaction was stop
    by adding 125 mM glycine. Hi-C librarires were prepared as described in Lieberman-Aiden
    et al. (Science, 2009).

  Growth-Protocol: Cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
    10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Homo sapiens
  Source: Breast cancer cell line
  Treatment-Protocol: For the experiments, cells were plated in RPMI medium without
    phenol red supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS and 48 hr
    later medium was replaced by fresh medium without serum. After 1 day in serum-free
    conditions, cells were incubated with R5020 (10 nM) 0 and 60 minutes

Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C\nBasecalls performed using Illumina pipeline\
  \ version 1.4.0\nChIP-Seq Single-end reads were processed by aligning to the reference\
  \ human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using Bowtie v1.0.0. ChIP-seq signals were summed in\
  \ windows of 100 Kb. Summed reads were normalized for sequencing depth and divided\
  \ by the corresponding signal obtained for an input DNA of T47D cells to determine\
  \ the normalized signal over input enrichment/depletion. Homer (Hypergeometric Optimization\
  \ of Motif EnRichment) v4.3 was used to find regions of significance enrichment\
  \ using an input as a control.\nHiC Paired-end reads were processed by first aligning\
  \ to the reference human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using BWA. Reads filtered from analysis\
  \ include those that were not uniquely mapped, mapped more than 500 bp from relevant\
  \ restriction sites, had bad sequence quality (e.g. 40% or more of the bases with\
  \ Sanger PHRED quality \u2264 2) or bad BWA mapping quality (\u2264 20), or were\
  \ located in regions classified to have exceptionally high sequence depth (top 0.1%)\
  \ by the 1000 Genomes project\u2019s data. To offset bias introduced by PCR amplification\
  \ of the sequencing library, only one of the duplicated pairs were used for subsequent\
  \ analyses. Datasets were used to generate contact matrices at 100 Kb.\nRNA-Seq\
  \ Paired-end reads were mapped using GEM mRNA Mapping Pipeline (v1.7) using last\
  \ Gencode Annotation version 18, which followed specific steps: 1) Map reads to\
  \ genome reference index (including chromosme 1 to X) with maximum mismatch ratio\
  \ of 0.06 and base quality threshold of 26. 2) Map reads to a transcriptome index\
  \ generated from previous reference index using same options as step 1. 3) Create\
  \ de-novo trasncriptome index and map again the reads to this index using maximum\
  \ mismatch ratio of 0.04, minimmum split size of 15 bp and maximmum of 500000 bp.\
  \ 4) Map reads again to de-novo transcriptome index created using same options as\
  \ step 1. 5) Merge mappings created and pair alignments using with base quality\
  \ threshold of 26 and maximmum insertion size of 500000 bp. As a result BAM alignment\
  \ files were obtained and used to generate strand-specific genome-wide normalized\
  \ profiles using RSeQC3 software. Exon quantifications summarized by per-genes for\
  \ expression level determination were obtained either as raw read counts and reads\
  \ per kilobase per milion mapped reads (RPKM) using Flux Capacitor.\nGenome_build:\
  \ hg19\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content: ChIP-seq data files are peak results\
  \ \u201CTSV\u201D files with genomic coordinates of peaks. HiC data files are whole\
  \ genome \u201CTSV\u201D matrices. RNA-Seq data file is a \u201CTSV\u201D table\
  \ which summarizes read counts per genes."
