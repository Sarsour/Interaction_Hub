  Extract-Protocol: 'Cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde, lysed and the nuclei
    was permeabilized. DNA was then cut with BglII restriction enzyme, the overhangs
    filled in incorporating a biotinylated base and the free ends were then ligated
    together. Crosslinks were reversed, the DNA was sheared to 300-500bp and the biotinylated
    ligation junctions were pulled down with streptavidin beads.

    Custom library construction protocol was followed. Briefly, DNA was end-repaired
    and dA-tailing using the NEBNext DNA Master Mixes kit and the ligation of universal
    adapter was performed on Streptavidin-bound DNA using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library
    Prep kit. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with indexed Illumina primers
    for 8-12 cycles and library fragments of at least 200bp were purified using SPRI
    beads. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation.
    Libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq2500 following the manufacturer''s protocols.'

Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C\nAll HiC libraries were processed through\
  \ the NGSane framework v0.5.2, using the \"fastqc\", \"hicup\" and \"fithicaggregate\"\
  \ modules.\nQuality check of sequence libraries was performed with FastQC v0.11.2.\
  \ Raw fastq files were\_then pre-processed, mapped with bowtie v1.1.0 and assessed\
  \ for artifact levels through HiCuP v0.5.2 supplying genome assembly (hg19) and\
  \ the BglII restriction enzyme cut site. Aligned read files in BAM format were sorted\
  \ with Samtools v1.2 and duplicates were tagged using MarkDuplicates from Picard\
  \ tools v1.121. Replicates were pooled using bespoke Python scripts (provided within\
  \ NGSane) leveraging the sparse matrices formats in the SciPy librarie.\nSignificant\
  \ connections were assessed from contact count matrices for multiple resolution\
  \ (100kb and 1Mb) using a custom adaptation of fit-hi-c (provided within NGSane)\
  \ supplying iteratively corrected bias offsets calculated through HiCorrector v1.1\
  \ as well as genome mappability tracks from ENCODE.\nGenome_build: hg19\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content:\
  \ Hi-C data files are normalized/corrected whole genome matrices binned at 100kb/1Mb.\
  \ The columns follow the fithic output format as follows: column1 chromosome name\
  \ for contact locus 1; column2 chromosomal position for contact locus 1 (midpoint\
  \ for given resolution); column3 chromosome name for contact locus 2; column4 chromosomal\
  \ position for contact locus 2 (midpoint for given resolution); column5 number of\
  \ contacts (read pairs) mapping between the two loci; column6 p-value; column7 q-value;\
  \ column8 HiCorrector bias for contact locus 1; column9 HiCorrector bias for contact\
  \ locus 2; column10 bias adjusted number of contacts. TADs were identified with\
  \ previously described \u201CHi-C Domain Caller\u201D pipeline by Ren\u2019s Lab\
  \ at 40kb resolution."
