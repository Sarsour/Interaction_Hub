  - Bgl II
  - T-helper cells (Th1)
  Extract-Protocol: 'Single cells treated according to the modified Hi-C protocol
    were isolated in PBS and incubated at 65 degrees C for overnight.

    The biotin-labelled DNA from each cell was bound to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin
    magnetic beads (Life Technologies), digested with Alu I (New England Biolabs),
    A-tailed with Klenow Fragment (3''->5'' exo-) (New England Biolabs) and dATP,
    ligated with customised Illumina adapter with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs),
    then the library was amplified by PCR with library amplification primers, and
    size-selected between 300 and 700 bp on an agarose gel.'
  Growth-Protocol: "CD4+ Th1 cells were prepared from spleens of male C57BL/6 mice\
    \ by stimulating the single cell suspension from spleen with 1 \xB5g/ml anti-CD3\
    \ (eBioscience) for 3 days in RPMI1640 medium with L-glutamine and 5% fetal calf\
    \ serum, purified using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD4 (Miltenyi Biotec),\
    \ and further expanded in the presence of 20 ng/ml IL-2 (Sigma)."

Data-Processing: "Paired-end reads of each multiplexed lane were paired-up and separated\
  \ to single cell datasets based on the 3 bp unique identification tags prefixing\
  \ each read. Read-pairs of each single cell were then processed independently. We\
  \ mapped read ends separately to the Mus musculus genome (assembly mm9) using the\
  \ Maq program with standard parameters and retained pairs of reads with unique hits\
  \ of high quality (q \u2265 30) at both ends. The first RE1 (Bgl II or Dpn II) restriction\
  \ site downstream of the read was identified and used as the fragment-end (fend)\
  \ associated with the read. We retained read-pairs that reflect informative ligation\
  \ events and with both ends mapped near the first RE2 (Alu I) site upstream of RE1\
  \ site. We discarded fend-pairs that were covered only once and used the list of\
  \ unique fend-pairs, ignoring the coverage of each pair. Fend-pairs with problematic\
  \ fragments (without a RE2 site or with a non-uniquely mapped start) were discarded.\
  \ Samples that confidently originated from single cell, with substantial number\
  \ of fend-pairs and with low noise levels were selected for the analysis.\nTh1_bgl_pool.txt\
