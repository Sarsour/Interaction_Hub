  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C was carried out as described (Belton et al., 2012) with
    a few modifications to account for Drosophila cell and genome size: 50 million
    fixed insect cells per sample were used and batches of 20 million cells each were
    digested with 400U HindIII as Hi-C samples with a control 3C sample of 10 million
    cells. Cohesive ends in Hi-C samples were filled in with dATP, dGTP, dTTP and
    biotin-14-dCTP. Then DNA was ligated, purified and sonicated. Size selection for
    ~230bp fragments carried out and then enriched for biotinylated specimen with
    straptavidin beads. Illumina paired-end adapters and PfuUltra II Fusion DNA polymerase
    were used for library generation. For all libraries 10 cycles of PCR amplification
    were used.'
  Growth-Protocol: S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's medium (Gibco) supplemented
    with 10% FCS and 0.05% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma-Aldrich) on shaking incubators at
    27C at a density of 2-16 million/ml.

  Basecalls performed using Illumina bcl2fastq 1.8.93

  Reads were mapped using bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012). For 4C, primer sequences
  were trimmed from reads.

  Hi-C: All reads that mapped multiple times to the genome were discarded as well
  as read pairs that were less than 1000 bp apart, that were more than 800 bp from
  a restriction site or that were duplicated.  Only reads having a mapping quality
  of at least 20 were considered. Hi-C matrices of different bin sizes were created
  by counting the number of times a Hi-C pair connected any two bins. The bin sizes
  considered were: 10.000 bp and restrictrion fragment size (RF).

  processed data files format and content: matrices of corrected Hi-C contact counts
  for different bin resolution.
