  Extract-Protocol: 'DNA was purified by PCI extraction and ethanol precipitation,
    treated with RNase A, and ~250-350 bp DNA was gel-purified following 3% agarose
    gel electrophoresis.

    Purified DNA was treated with End-it, subject to A-tailing with Exo- Klenow, and
    ligated to Illumina adaptors. Adaptor-ligated DNA was then purified with streptavidin
    beads to isolate ligated Micro-C products away from undigested dinucleosomal DNA.
    Streptavidin beads were then subject to ~12-15 cycles of PCR using Illumina paired-end
    primers.

    Amplified library was purified and subject to Illumina HiSeq or Nextseq paired
    end sequencing with 50 bp or 100 bp reads.'
  Growth-Protocol: 100mL yeast culture were grown to midlog phase ~OD 0.55 in YPD
    media at 30 C.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  Source: Yeast_H4R23A
  Treatment-Protocol: Yeast cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 15 min, and
    quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cells were pelleted, spheroplasted with
    Zymolyase, and treated with a level of MNase yielding >95% mononucleosom. After
    stopping MNase, chromatin supernatant was dephosphorylated using Antarctic phosphatase.
    Crosslinked chromatin was subject to T4 DNA polymerase / T4 PNK enzyme mix solution
    to generate blunt ends. Crosslinked chromatin was diluted into 10 mL and treated
    with T4 DNA ligase. After heat inactivation, chromatin was concentrated to 250uL,
    and treated with 100U of exonuclease III for 5 min to eliminate biotinylated ends
    of unligated DNA. Proteinase K was then added and incubated for 65 C overnight.
