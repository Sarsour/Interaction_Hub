  Extract-Protocol: 'The in-situ Hi-C experiments were performed similarly as described
    (Rao SSP, et al. 2014. A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals
    principles of chromatin looping. Cell 159: 1665-1680).

    The GRO-Seq experiments were performed as described (Core LJ, Waterfall JJ, Lis
    JT. 2008. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation
    at human promoters. Science 322: 1845-8).

    The ChIP-Seq experiments were performed similarly as described (Lin YC, et al.
    2012. Global changes in the nuclear positioning of genes and intra- and interdomain
    genomic interactions that orchestrate B cell fate. Nat Immunol 13: 1196-1204).

    The MeDIP-Seq experiments were performed similarly as described (Pomraning KR,
    Smith KM, Freitag M. 2009. Genome-wide high throughput analysis of DNA methylation
    in eukaryotes. Methods 47: 142-150).

    For RNA-Seq: total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated
    with TURBO DNase (Life Technologies). mRNA was purified from total RNA using Dynabeads
    mRNA purification kit (Life Technologies).cDNA was generated with the First-strand
    synthesis kit (Life Technologies) using a combination of random hexamers and oligo(dT)
    in presence of actinomycin D. Second-strand synthesis was performed with dUTP
    instead of dTTP. The ds-cDNA was sonicated to 200-400 bp using the S220 Focused-ultrasonicator
    (Covaris).

    Hi-C libraries were prepared with the NEBNext primer set and were selected by
    size by 6% PAGE and sequenced for 50 cycles on Illumina HiSeq 2500.

    GRO-Seq libraries were prepared with custom GRO-Seq PCR primers and were selected
    by size by 8% PAGE and sequenced for 50 cycles on Illumina HiSeq 2000.

    ChIP-Seq and MeDIP-Seq libraries were prepared with the NEBNext primer set and
    were selected by size by 8% PAGE and sequenced for 50 cycles on Illumina HiSeq
    2000 or 2500.

    RNA-Seq ibraries were prepared with the TruSeq primer set and were selected by
    size by 8% PAGE and sequenced for 50 cycles on Illumina HiSeq 2000.'
  Growth-Protocol: "GM-CSF-dependent ECOMG cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10%\
    \ FBS and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine, by the addition of 1:100 conditioned\
    \ media (about 10 ng/mL GM-CSF) isolated from a B16 melanoma cell line stably\
    \ transfected with a murine GM-CSF construct. b-estradiol where applicable, was\
    \ added to the medium at a final concentration of 1 mM from a 10,000\u2009\xD7\
    \ stock in 100% ethanol. Differentiation of ECOMG cells into granulocytes was\
    \ induced by withdrawal \u03B2-estradiol for 5 days.\nC57BL/6J mice were housed\
    \ in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the Institutional Animal\
    \ Care and Use Committee of University of California, San Diego. Bone marrow derived\
    \ neutrophils were separated by EasySepTM Mouse Neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Stem\
    \ Cell Technologies, 19762). Bone marrow cells were harvested from femur, tibia\
    \ and crista iliac. Bone marrow cells were incubated with a cocktail of biotinylated\
    \ lineage specific antibodies (EasySepTM Mouse Neutrophil Enrichment Cocktail),\
    \ conjugated with EasySepTM Biotin Selection Cocktail, labeled with EasySepTM\
    \ D Magnetic Particles, followed by depletion of biotin-labeled cells with EasySep\u2122\
    \ Magnet."

Data-Processing: 'The paired-end Hi-C reads were truncated at GATCGATC site, aligned
  separately to the mm9 genome using BOWTIE2, only keeping read pairs if both ends
  mapped to unique locations. The two reads were merged into pairs using HOMER (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/).
  Read alignment filtering and other Hi-C processing including normalization was performed
  using HOMER. Reads passing these filters are included in the Hi-C summary files.
  Principle component analysis of normalized Hi-C interaction frequency matrices was
  performed using HOMER and R. Hi-C statistics was processed using HiCUP(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/).

  For ChIP-Seq, MeDIP-Seq and GRO-Seq samples (single end reads), reads were aligned
  to the mm9 genome using BOWTIE2, keeping only reads that mapped unique locations.
  Aligned read files were analyzed with HOMER to find peaks, generate bedGraph, calculate
  RPKM from the gene bodies of RefFlat genes, and perform other analyses in the study.

  RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the mm9 reference genome using Tophat2. RPKMs for
  each RefFlat gene were calculated from aligned reads using Cufflink. For a gene
  to be considered expressed the cutoff of FPKM is 0.5.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed files include BED files (ChIP-Seq
  peak or region positions, Hi-C PC1 domain positions), FKPM CSV files (RNA-Seq expression
  data), RPKM CSV files (GRO-Seq expression data), BEDGRAPH (ChIP-Seq, duplicates-combined
  GRO-Seq and MeDIP-Seq tracks, principle component values along the genome for combined
  Hi-C data), and TXT files, including Hi-C summary files (filtered read pairs from
  combined Hi-C data processed using HOMER; filtered read pairs from each Hi-C replicates
  processed using HiCUP), columns: Read Name, chromosome for read 1, positions for
  read 1 (5'' end of read, one-indexed), strand of read 1, chromosome for read 2,
  positions for read 2 (5'' end of read, one-indexed), strand of read 2), as well
  as Hi-C background files from HOMER.'
