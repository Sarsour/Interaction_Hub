  Extract-Protocol: "~3000-4000 embryos were dechorionated for 5 min in fresh bleach,\
    \ before douncing in 5 ml fix buffer (2% formaldehyde, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 60\
    \ mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton-X100, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor\
    \ cocktail (Roche)) and fixed for a total of 10 min at 25\xB0C, 750 rpm on a shaker.\
    \ After quenching with 5 ml 2 M glycine, nuclei were collected by centrifugation\
    \ for 5 min at 4500 g, 4\xB0C, then washed once with 5 ml fix buffer (without\
    \ formaldehyde) and once with 1.25 x NEB3 buffer (New England Biolabs), with centrifugation\
    \ for 5 min at 4500 g, 4\xB0C each time. Nuclei were resuspended in 300 \xB5l\
    \ 1.25 x Dpn II buffer (New England Biolabs) plus 0.3% SDS and incubated for 1\
    \ hr at 37\xB0C, 1000 rpm on a shaker. Triton-X100 was added to a final concentration\
    \ of 2% and the nuclei were incubated for a further 1 hr at 37\xB0C, 1000 rpm,\
    \ before overnight digestion with 1500 U Dpn II (New England Biolabs) at 37\xB0\
    C, 1000 rpm. The restriction enzyme was inactivated by incubation for 20 min at\
    \ 65\xB0C, 1000 rpm with SDS at a final concentration of 1.3%, before dilution\
    \ of the chromatin in 10 ml 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) plus\
    \ 1% Triton-X100 and incubation for 1 hr at 37\xB0C, 750 rpm. The chromatin was\
    \ ligated for 4 hr at 25\xB0C, 750 rpm with 40,000 U T4 DNA ligase (New England\
    \ Biolabs) then crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65\xB0C, 750 rpm in the\
    \ presence of 150 \xB5g/ml proteinase K. The 3C DNA was then purified by 1 hr\
    \ treatment with 40 \xB5g/ml RNase A at 37\xB0C, 750 rpm, phenol extraction, phenol/chloroform\
    \ extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was quantified with the Qubit\
    \ dsDNA assay (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 5 \xB5g 3C DNA were sonicated in a Bioruptor\
    \ (Diagenode) in 50 \xB5l volumes in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,\
    \ 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) to obtain a smear between 500-1500 bp. The sonicated 3C\
    \ DNA was then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation\
    \ and quantified with the Qubit dsDNA assay (Invitrogen). Libraries for paired-end\
    \ sequencing were made from 500 ng aliquots of sonicated 3C DNA using Illumina\
    \ reagents and protocols, with size selection for products of ~800 bp."
  Growth-Protocol: "Oregon-R w1118 flies were raised in standard cornmeal yeast extract\
    \ media at 25\xB0C. Egg laying was performed on plates with standard vinegar medium\
    \ and yeast. Embryos were collected in 0.03% Triton-X100, 0.4% NaCl 16-18 hr after\
    \ egg laying."

Data-Processing: 'Paired-end reads were mapped to the Drosophila melanogaster genome
  (assembly dm3) using the bowtie program with parameters (-t -a -m 1 --best).  Unmapped
  or non-unique mapped reads were discarded.

  We then divided read pairs into four groups: SS (reads mapping to the same restriction
  fragment, or to two adjacent restriction fragments); S2 (reads in which both ends
  mapped precisely on the DpnII site); S1 (reads in which one of the ends mapped precisely
  on the DpnII site); S0 (reads in which both ends did not map precisely to a DpnII
  site). SS, S2 and S1 pairs were discarded from subsequent analysis.

  Mapped reads were then associated with the first restriction fragment end encountered
  when moving from the mapped position in the appropriate strand.

  All subsequent analysis was done in the space of fragment end pairs. The Drosophila
  genome contains 464,246 restriction fragments. After discarding low mappability
  fragments 301,687 fragments are left (and each defines two fragment ends).

  A model accounting for systematic biases in contact probability was constructed
  as previously (Yaffe and Tanay; Nature Genetics, 43, p.1059-65). Briefly, we used
  the local G+C content of up to 200 bp from the restriction site (agc, bgc), and
  the DpnII restriction fragment lengths (alen, blen), to correct for systematic biases
  in Hi-C coverage by modeling: P(Xa,b) = Pprior x Flen(alen,blen) x Fgc(agc,bgc).

  We estimated maximum likelihood model parameters (the matrices Flen and Fgc) through
  application of an iterative algorithm as described, using 20 bins for G+C content
  and 20 bins for fragment length.
