Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - primary liver cells
  - Young adult
  Extract-Protocol: 'After liver homogenisation, cells were immediately fixed with
    1% formaldehyde before proceeding with Hi-C protocol.

    Ligated material was sonicated, enriched for biotinylated ligation junctions and
    PE sequencing adapters were added according to Illumina standard protocols'
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Canis lupus familiaris
  Source: Liver
  position: '1'
Channel-Count: '1'

  ref: contrib1
Data-Processing: 'Read alignment was done by using Bowtie v0.12.8 with the parameters
  "-v 3 -a -m 1 --best --strata".

  HiC data analysis was done using hicpipe v1.01 (Yaffe and Tanay, 2011)

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: HiCseq_summary'' is a tab-delimited text
  file summarizing alignment results for all samples. All other processed data files
  are cis-interaction maps reporting observed and expected values for contacts between
  50 Kb bins separated by up to 2 Mb. One processed data file is supplied for each
  replicate plus a merge of the two replicates for each species. The files are in
  a modified bed format (with header) in which the first three columns are the coordinate
  of the first bin (chrom1, start1, end1), the second three columns are the coordinates
  of the second bin (chrom2, start2, end2) and the last two columns are the expected
  and observed interaction counts.'
