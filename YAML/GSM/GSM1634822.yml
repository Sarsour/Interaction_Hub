  Characteristics:
  - C57BL/6
  - BMDM cells (7th day of differentiation)
  - HindIII
  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiment were conducted in biological replicates using
    HindIII, according to the protocol published by Belton JM. Et al. Methods 2012
    (PMID: 22652625) except for using 2% formaldehyde.

    DNA libraries were prepared during Hi-C protocol according to experimental procedures
    described in Belton JM. Et al. Methods 2012 (PMID: 22652625).'
  Growth-Protocol: "At day zero bone marrow cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice\
    \ and 1,5 \xD7 10^6 cells/plate were seeded in 10 cm dishes in 10 ml of TET-free\
    \ BM medium (high glucose DMEM supplemented with 20% low endotoxin fetal bovine\
    \ serum, 30% L929-conditioned medium, 1% glutamine, 1%, Pen/Strep, 0.5% Sodium\
    \ Pyruvate, 0.1% \u03B2-mercaptoethanol). Cultures were fed with 2.5 ml of fresh\
    \ medium every two days."

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: HiC-Seq

  Reads were quality filtered according to the Illumina pipeline

  The two ends of each paired-end sequenced fragment were separately aligned to the
  mm9 genome using NovoAlign (http://novocraft.com) (-s 2 -l 40)

  Scripts provided with HOMER (PMID: 20513432) were used HiC data processing. As a
  first step, the makeTagDirectory script was run with the following parameters: restrictionSite
  AAGCTT -removeSelfLigation -removePEbg -genome mm9 -removeSpikes 10000 5. Then a
  background model considering a 40 kbps window was generated with the analyzeHiC
  script, using the following parameters: -res 40000 -bgonly

  Locations of topologically associated domains (TADs) were computed using the scripts
  provided by Dixon et al. 2012 (PMID: 22495300)

  Genome_build: mm9 (NCBI Build 37)

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The archive BMDMs_UT_HindIII.noSelfLigation.raw.tgz
  contains one file per chromosome showing the matrix of cis-interactions among all
  pairs of 40 kbps bins. BMDMs_UT_HindIII.noSelfLigation.raw.TADs.bed contains the
  coordinates of TADs.'
