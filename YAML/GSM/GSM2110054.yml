  Extract-Protocol: "Oocytes were fixed in with 2% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at\
    \ room temperature. Oocytes were washed through drops of complete M2. For SN and\
    \ NSN distinction oocytes were stained for 15 min with 0.2 \xB5g/ml Hoechst (33342,\
    \ Invitrogen). Cells were then imaged using a LSM510 (Zeiss) confocal microscope\
    \ and sorted according to their chromatin structure before proceeding with the\
    \ Hi-C protocol. After fixation, single oocytes were incubated in 9 \u03BCl of\
    \ lysis buffer for at least 15 minutes on ice. Similarly cells were incubated\
    \ in 9 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 NEB3 buffer supplemented with 0.6% SDS for 2 hours at\
    \ 37\xB0 with shaking in humidified atmosphere. Then cells were incubated in 1\xD7\
    \ DpnII buffer (NEB) with 1\xD7 BSA and  5 U DpnII (NEB). After overnight incubation\
    \ in a humidified incubator at 37\xB0 the DNA ends were ligated in 9 \u03BCl of\
    \ 1\xD7 T4 DNA ligase buffer containing 5 U T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific)\
    \ and they were incubated at 16\xB0C for 4.5 hours with 50 rpm rotation, and then\
    \ were kept for 30 min at room temperature. DNA from each nucleus was amplified\
    \ using illustra GenomiPhi v2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare) or illustra\
    \ Single Cell GenomiPhi DNA amplification kit according to manufacturer's recommendations,\
    \ but both protocols were modified to include a decrosslinking step of an overnight\
    \ (14-16 hours) incubation at 65\xB0C. After the whole-genome amplification procedure,\
    \ the DNA was purified. 1 \u03BCg (or all available amount, if the yield was lower)\
    \ of DNA was diluted to 500 \u03BCl with sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH\
    \ 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) and was sonicated using Branson Sonifier 150 for\
    \ 20 seconds with power setting 3. The sonicated DNA was purified and then submitted\
    \ for library preparation and sequencing.\nThe library preparation was done by\
    \ the VBCF NGS unit (vbcf.ac.at) following the standard DNA sample  preparation\
    \ protocol for Solexa platforms (NEB reagents)."
  Growth-Protocol: Fully grown denuded GV oocytes were isolated from 2-3 month old
    C57BL/6J mice by puncturing of ovaries with hypodermic needles28. Oocytes were
    incubated for at least 2 hours before the procedure to ensure viability. Before
    formaldehyde fixation, the zona pellucida was removed by treatment with Acidic
    Tyrode's solution (Sigma).

Data-Processing: 'Base calling was performed by VBCF NGS unit

  Mapping: iterative mapping (see Imakaev et al, 2012) using bowtie2 with increased
  stringency parameters: --score-min -L 0.6,0.2--very-  sensitive

  Read filtering: if two reads map to the same strands, and each side of the read
  is within 500 bp of any side of the other read, we retained only one copy of the
  read.

  Additional filtering: we separated the genome into 500 bp bins. If any two bins
  were interacting more than once, only one interaction was counted. Since each region
  is only present in the single cell up to 4 times (in oocytes), we eliminated all
  500 bp bins that form more than 8 unique interactions with other bins.

  Filtered reads were then binned at different resolutions (we provide files at 200Kb
  resolution) using read start as a read position. No normalization was applied to
  the data.
