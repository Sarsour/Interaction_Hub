  Characteristics: [Kc167, HindIII, 'biological 1, technical 1']
  Extract-Protocol: Hi-C experiments were carried out as described (Lieberman-Aiden
    et al., 2009) with some modifications. Cells were lysed then the nuclei were treated
    with 0.1% SDS at 65 degree for 10mins and the SDS was quenched by adding Triton
    X-100 to final 1% concentration. Nuclei was digested in 1XNEB (New England Biolaboratory)
    with 400U of HindIII. Digested DNA was blunted with dATP, dGTP, dTTP and biotin
    labeled dCTP.  DNA wan then ligated and puried. biotin-labled ligated DNA was
    purified with streptavidin beads. Illumina paired-end adaptor linkers were ligated
    to DNA pulled-down and amplified and size selected for sequencing.
  Growth-Protocol: Fruit fly embryonic Kc167 cells were grown to confluence in CCM3
    serum-free insect medium (HyClone SH30065.01) at 25oC and collected for Hi-C experiments.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Drosophila melanogaster
  Source: Kc167
  Treatment-Protocol: One hundred million Kc167 cells were suspended in 40ml of CM3
    medium, fixed by adding 37% formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%, and incubated
    at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/10 volumes
    of 1.25 M glycine solution and incubated for 5 min before centrifugation at 3000
    rpm for 10 min.

Data-Processing: 'base-calling was carried out by HudsonAlpha Genomic Service Center

  Paired reads were aligned to the Drosophila reference genome (Dm3) using Bowtie
  0.12.7 (Langmead et al., 2009)  and filtered to remove any pair with one or two
  ends aligned to multiple locations.

  GC content and fragment length effects were normalized as described before (Yaffe
  and Tanay, 2011)

  Genome_build: Dm3

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: txt files for the aligned paired reads from
  two technical replicates, one biological replicate. 4 columns in each file with
  the first two columns corresponding to chromosomes and genomic coordinates of the
  first reads, and the last two columns corresponding to chromosomes and genomic coordicates
  of the second reads respectively.'
