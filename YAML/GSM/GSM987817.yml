  Extract-Protocol: "ChIP-seq: Lysates were clarified from sonicated cells and protein-DNA\
    \ complexes were isolated with antibody. Libraries were prepared according to\
    \ Illumina's instructions. Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of\
    \ T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and\
    \ T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow\
    \ fragment (minus exo) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation\
    \ of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3\u2019\
    \ end. After adapter ligation, ChIP DNA was PCR-amplified with Illumina primers\
    \ with the respective indexes for 18 cycles and library fragments (ChIP) (insert\
    \ plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were size- selected from a 8% polyacrylamide\
    \ gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation.\
    \ Libraries were sequenced on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina) or HiSeq 2000 (Illumina)\
    \ following the manufacturer's protocols.\nGRO-seq: GRO-Seq was performed as described\
    \ (Core, L.J., Waterfall, J.J., and Lis, J.T., Science 322, 1845-1848 (2008))\
    \ with minor modifications. Briefly, nuclei from 10 million cells isolated by\
    \ hypotonic lysis, and RNA polymerases were run-on for 5 minutes at 30\xB0C in\
    \ the presence of sarkosyl, BrUTP, ATP, GTP and limiting concentrations of CTP.\
    \ Total RNA was purified with Trizol/isopropanol precipitiation, DNAse-treated\
    \ (TURBO-DNase, Ambion), fragmented with fragmentation buffer (Ambion), and re-buffered\
    \ by size exclusion chromatography. RNA fragments were 3' dephosphorylated with\
    \ polynucleotide kinase (Enzymatics), and BrUTP-labeled run-on RNA was immunopurified\
    \ with anti-BrdUTP-coated agarose beads, washed, eluted and EtOH-precipitated.\
    \ Run-on RNA was then de-capped with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre),\
    \ 5' phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase (Enzymatics) and purified with\
    \ Trizol LS/isopropanol precipitiation. Sequencing libraries were prepared by\
    \ ligating a single-stranded, 3'-blocked, 5'-adenylated 3\u2019 oligonucleotide\
    \ with mutant (K227Q) truncated RNA ligase 2 (NEB) to the 3' end of the RNA fragments,\
    \ followed by annealing a reverse transcription primer complementary to the 3'\
    \ adapter to suppress adapter dimer formation, and ligating a hybrid 5' DNA-RNA\
    \ oligonucleotide using RNA ligase I and then reverse-transcribing with SuperScript\
    \ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was purified with AMPure XL\
    \ beads and PCR-amplified with primers bearing primer landing sites compatible\
    \ with Illumina indexed sequencing. The library was size-selected on a PAGE gel\
    \ to 60-110 bp insert size and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).\nHi-C: The\
    \ Hi-C experiment was performed similarly as described (Lieberman-Aiden, E., et\
    \ al., Science 326, 289-293 (2009)). Libraries were subjected to paired-end sequencing\
    \ on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina)."
  Growth-Protocol: "Tcf(E2A)-deficient multipoint progenitors were derived from E2A-deficient\
    \ fetal liver and grown in the presence of IL7, SCF and FLT3L on sub-confluent\
    \ S17 stromal cells.  B220 MACS enriched Rag1-deficient bone marrow cells were\
    \ grown in Opti-MEM 10% FCS/ 2% PSG/ 50 \u03BCM \u03B2-mercaptoethanol in the\
    \ presence of IL7 and SCF for 7 days."

Data-Processing: 'For ChIP-Seq and GRO-Seq samples (single end reads), reads were
  aligned to the mm9 genome using bowtie (v0.12.7), keeping only reads that mapped
  best to a single, unique location.  Aligned read files were analyzed with HOMER
  (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/) to find peaks, calculate RPKM from the gene bodies
  of RefSeq genes, and perform other analyses in the study.

  For Hi-C samples (paired end reads), read ends were aligned separately to the mm9
  genome using bowtie (v0.12.7), only keeping read pairs if both ends mapped best
  to unique locations.  Four additional filtering steps were applied to the mapped
  reads: 1) Duplicate read pairs aligning to the exact same positions were removed
  (possible PCR amplification artifacts). 2) Reads aligning within 2x the library
  size (estimated library insert size = 400) were removed (representing genomic background/religation
  events).  3) Read pairs where neither read was within 500 bp of a HindIII site were
  removed. (background ligation events) 4) Read pairs aligning to adjacent restriction
  enzyme sites representing circularization of a HindIII fragment were removed.  Reads
  passing these filters are included in the Hi-C summary files.  Read alignment filtering
  and other Hi-C processing including normalization was performed using HOMER (http://biowhat.ucsd.edu/homer/).  Principle
  component analysis of normalized Hi-C interaction frequency matrices was performed
  using HOMER and R (www.r-project.org).  Results for the first principle component
  are included as BEDGRAPH files.  Positive principle component values correspond
  to regions that are generally transcriptionally active.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed files include BED files (ChIP-Seq
  peak positions), rpkm text files (GRO-Seq expression data), BEDGRAPH (principle
  component values along the genome for Hi-C), and Hi-C summary files (raw filtered
  read pairs from Hi-C data, columns: readName, chr1, 5'' position1, strand1, chr2,
  5'' position2,strand2 [positions are 1-index based]).  All genomic coordinates are
  relative to mm9 (NCBI 37) mouse assembly.'
