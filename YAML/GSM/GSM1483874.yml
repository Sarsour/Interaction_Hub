  Extract-Protocol: "Approximately six million NHEK and ten million KBM7 cells were\
    \ fixed in 1.5% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 minutes. The fixed cells\
    \ were washed with TN buffer (10 mM Tris, 40 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and collected by\
    \ centrifugation at 600 g for 3 minutes. To increase digestion efficiency, fixed\
    \ cells (6 or 10 million / 122 ul) were treated with SDS (add 3.8 ul of 10% SDS\
    \ to a final of 0.30% SDS) at 64\xB0C for 10 minutes and then at 37\xB0C overnight\
    \ (15 hours). The SDS concentration was reduced gradually to 0.10% by adding five\
    \ times of 50 ul (1 x DpnII digestion buffer or NEB buffer 4 for multiple enzymes)\
    \ with mixing. Triton X-100 (38 ul of 20% Triton X) was added to 1.8% concentration\
    \ and the sample was incubated at  37\xB0C for 1 hour. Sample volume was adjusted\
    \ to 600 ul by adding 1 X restriction buffer, ATP (0.2 mM final) and BSA (100\
    \ ug/ml final). Digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes (300 units each)\
    \ was carried out on a rotate shaker at 37\xB0C for 15 hours. We used high concentration\
    \ NEB enzymes to keep the final volume of the enzyme mixture less than 60 ul (1/10\
    \ reaction volume). The digested samples were deactivated at 65\xB0C for 15 minutes\
    \ and then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 min. We recovered ~95% of cellular DNA\
    \ in the pellet fraction. The pellet fraction was re-suspended with T4 ligation\
    \ buffer (15 ul 10 x buffer, 65 ul total) heated at 65\xB0C and mixed with 100\
    \ ul of melted 2.5% low-melting agarose. We used 200 ul pipette to deliver the\
    \ hot agarose sample to ice-cold ligation buffer (800 ul of 1 x ligation buffer\
    \ containing T4 ligase (4000 units, NEB) in a steady fashion within ~5 seconds,\
    \ on melted ice. Strings of gel bead appeared instantly at 0\xB0C. We sealed the\
    \ tube with parafilm and perform ligation at RT (23\xB0C.) overnight on top of\
    \ a shaker (~300 rpm), then transfer the tube to a iced water bath. The sample\
    \ pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 2 minutes, then 10 ul\
    \ of 1% SDS (0.05% final) was added and heated at 80\xB0C for 1 hour. Cross-links\
    \ were reversed by treatment with Proteinase K (200 ug/ml) at 65\xB0C and 300\
    \ rpm overnight (12 hours). Melted TM3C-agarose sample was incubated with RNase\
    \ A (10 ug / 210 ul) at 55\xB0C for 15 minutes and then purified by QIAquick gel\
    \ extraction protocol (QUIAGEN Inc., CA). Purified TM3C DNA was quantified using\
    \ both a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer.\
    \ The Qubit quantification represents the more accurate DNA concentration.\nSize-selected\
    \ fragments were paired-end sequenced (100 bp per end) after adding sequencing\
    \ adaptors using Illumina Hi-Seq 2000."

Data-Processing: 'We mapped the paired-end reads to the human reference genome (hg19)
  using the short read alignment mode  of BWA (v0.5.9) with default parameter settings.
  Each end of the paired reads was mapped individually.  We post-processed the alignment
  results to extract the reads that satisfy the following three criteria: (i)  mapped
  uniquely to one location in the reference genome, (ii) mapped with an alignment
  quality score of  at least 30, (iii) mapped with an edit distance of at most 3.
  Reads that satisfy these criteria are named  fully-mapped (F), and the rest of the
  mapped reads that did not satisfy these criteria are discarded from  further analysis.
  We identified pairs of fully-mapped reads that share a common identifier to generate
  the  set of contacts that we denote as F-F (fully-mapped - fully-mapped). The reads
  that did not map to any  location in this phase of mapping are named non-mapped
  and are analyzed further.

  Within each non-mapped read, we first counted the number of cleavage sites, taking
  into account all the  restriction enzymes that are used in the digestion step for
  that specific library. We discarded reads that  contain more than two cleavage sites.
  We also discarded reads that contain no cleavage sites because such  reads surely
  are not chimeric.

  We split the remaining reads, which contain one or two cleavage sites, into  two
  or three smaller fragments, respectively, preserving the entire cleavage site on
  both adjacent fragments.  We only kept the largest two fragments from each read.
  We mapped the resulting fragments to the genome  using BWA with default parameter
  settings. The 3-point filtering criteria mentioned in the previous section  are
  applied to the aligned reads, but allowing an edit distance of at most 1 to make
  sure we only extract  the unique and high quality mappings.

  The reads that are extracted from this phase of mapping are named  partially-mapped
  (P) because they did not map as a whole, but their constituent fragments were successfully  mapped
  to different loci. The two classes of mapped reads (fully-mapped (F) and partially-mapped
  (P))  yield three possible types of contacts, namely F-F, F-P/P-F and P-P. The first
  set (F-F) is extracted after the  initial mapping in which each paired-end read
  can contribute at most one interaction between two loci. The  second set (F-P/P-F)
  consists of paired-end reads with one end fully mapped and the other end having
  either one  or two smaller fragments that mapped to the genome. If the latter contains
  only one mapped fragment, then  the only interaction is between this fragment and
  the fully-mapped end. However, if the end has two mapped  fragments, then this paired-end
  read produces three contacts: one between the two mapped fragments on  the partially-mapped
  end and two others that have one side from a fragment from the partially-mapped
  end  and the other side from the fully-mapped end. In addition, the same paired-end
  read produces one triple  (i.e., interaction among three loci) of type F-P/P-F.
  For the contacts of the third type (P-P), each paired-end  can produce either one,
  three or six binary contacts, depending on whether one or two fragments from each  end
  are successfully mapped. If only one fragment from one end and two from the other
  is mapped, then,  similar to the case of P-F, three binary contacts and one triple
  is produced. If both ends have two mapped  fragments, then six binary contacts,
  four triples (of type P-P) and one quadruple (i.e., contact among four  loci) are
  produced.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed data files contain the pairwise
  (doubles) and multi-locus contacts for each library that is not an experimental
  control. For pairwise contacts we used BEDPE file format (see http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/general-usage.html)
  with name field (column 7) representing the contact type (F-F or F-P or P-F or P-P)
  and score field (column 8) listing the read ID for cross referencing with fastq
  files. For contacts that link more than two loci simultaneously, we extended the
  BEDPE format to include triples (extension BEDTE) and quadruples (extension BEDQE)
  of genomic regions. Each line of a BEDTE or a BEDQE file first lists the coordinates
  of each locus then the contact type and read ID columns and finally the mapping
  strands of each locus in order.'
