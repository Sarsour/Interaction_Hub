  Hi-C reads were aligned as single end reads using BWA with default parameters.  Uniquely
  mapping reads were manually paired using in an in house pipeline.  PCR duplicate
  reads were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates.

  RNA-seq data were mapped as paired-end reads using tophat with the following parameters:
  -g 1 -p 12 --solexa1.3-quals --library-type fr-firststrand --segment-length 25 --bowtie1

  RNA-seq bigWig files were generated through an in house pipeline that includes performing
  trimmed mean of M (TMM) normalization (Robinson et al. Genome Biology 2010)

  ChIP-seq data were mapping with bowtie using the following parameters: -v 3 -m 1
  --best --strata -S --time -p 8.  Data was filtered for uniquely mapping reads.  PCR
  duplicates were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates

  ChIP-seq bigWig files were generated through an in house pipeline

  Genome_build: hg18

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: ChIP-seq and RNA-seq processed files are
  in bigWig format.  As the RNA-seq experiment was strand specific, bigWig files for
  both the positive and negative strands are included

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Hi-C processed files are in a modified bed
  format.  Each row lists the chromosome and the start and end coordiates of two interacting
  bins as well as the normalized interaction frequency between these two bins

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Processed mRNA-seq data include information
  for each gene and its count and rpkm values.  Each line includes chromosome, start
  position, end position, strand, gene name, read counts, and rpkm values
