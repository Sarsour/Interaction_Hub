  Extract-Protocol: "For Hi-C, 25 X 106 cells were cross linked with 1% formaldehyde\
    \ in situ. Cross linked cells were harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.\
    \ For RNA-seq, We used TRIzolr Reagent to extract RNA from cells grown in 6-well\
    \ plates. Full details in\_PMC4491792.\nAll extracted RNA was treated with RNAse-free\
    \ DNaseI, then submitted to the University of Michigan Bioinformaics Core lab\
    \ for library construction andRNA-seq on the Illumina Hiseq-2000 platform. Single-end\
    \ 50-base sequence reads were generated at a multiplex of 4 per sequencing lane.\
    \ We adopted the methods for Hi- C library construction from Belton et al. (Methods\
    \ 58:268, 2012). Full details in\_PMC4491792."
  Growth-Protocol: Fibroblasts (CRL-2522) were grown in MEM, 10% FBS, X non-essential
    amino acids, and 1X antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells were dissociated with 0.25%
    trypsin then plated in 150mm plates for Hi-C, and 6-well plates for RNA-seq.

  Treatment-Protocol: "Cell cycle synchronization was performed by serum-starvation\
    \ for 48 hours. After 48th hours, we added dexamethasone to 100nM or ethanol to\
    \ the control group. 1 hr later baseline samples were taken and time 0 was set.\
    \ Thereafter, time series sampling of cells treated with dexamethasone was performed\
    \ at 8-hour intervals for a total of 56 hours. Full details in\_PMC4491792"
