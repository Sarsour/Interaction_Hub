Data-Processing: "Hi-C reads were mapped to hg19 using BWA-MEM. Reads were aligned\
  \ as single ends, and read pairs are then re-constructed after mapping.\nUnmapped\
  \ reads were filtered out and PCR duplicate reads were removed with PicardTools\
  \ MarkDuplicates.\nContact matrices were constructed at 40kb resolution and normalized\
  \ with HiCNorm (Hu, M. et al., Bioinformatics. 2012. PMID: 23023982).\nTopologically\
  \ associated domains (\u201CTADs\u201D) were identified based on Directionality\
  \ Index (\u201CDI\u201D) as described previously (Dixon et al., Nature. 2012. PMID:\
  \ 22495300), with one exception: DI was calculated using a sliding window of 300\
  \ kb upstream/downstream of the view point.\nGenome_build: hg19"
