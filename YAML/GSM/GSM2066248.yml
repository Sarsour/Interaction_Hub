  Extract-Protocol: "Limbs were re-suspended in Trypsin and incubated for 10 minutes\
    \ at 37\xB0C. Tissues were disrupted by pipetting and single cells were retrieved\
    \ using cell strainer and fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature in 10ml (2%PFA,\
    \ 10%FCS, 1XPBS). Final 140mM glycine was added to stop crosslinking. Cells were\
    \ then lysed for 10\u2019 at 4\xB0C in  lysis buffer (50mM TRIS pH7.5, 150mM NaCl,\
    \ 5mM EDTA, 0.5%NP-40, 1.15% TX-100 and 1X Proteinase Inhibitor).\nSheared DNA\
    \ was then ligated to adaptors and 4 amplification cycles were performed prior\
    \ to SureSelect hybridization. 700ng of adaptor-ligated DNA was hybridized to\
    \ the custom probes according to Agilent instructions. Hybridized fragments were\
    \ then amplified (12 cycles) and products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads.\
    \ Each sample was sequence on an individual Illumina HiSeq lane following a 100bp\
    \ paired-end mode."

Data-Processing: "Base calling with standard Illumina Software\nMapping and filtering\
  \ of di-tags was performed with the HiCUP pipeline v0.5.8 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/)\
  \ (parameters: Nofill:1 Format: Sanger  without any size selection). The pipeline\
  \ used Bowtie2 v2.2.6 for mapping short reads to reference genome (NCBI37/mm9).\n\
  Filtered di-tags were further processed with Juicebox command line tools (https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicebox)\
  \ to bin di-tags (10kb bins) and normalized by KR normalization (Only reads with\
  \ MAPQ >= 30 were considered). The DNA-capturing step enriches genomic region chr11:109,010,001-114,878,000\
  \ on mm9 . Before binning and normalization, di-tags were filtered for the enriched\
  \ region and mm9 coordinates were shifted by -109,010,000 bp (a custom chromosome\
  \ file containing only the enriched region on chr11 (length 5,868,000 bp) was used).\
  \ After binning and normalization, coordinates were shifted back to their original\
  \ values.\nDifference maps were generated based on raw count maps which were scaled\
  \ individually by dividing each value of the matrix by a factor (sum \u2018masked\u2019\
  \ triangle matrix/106). The region spanning all tested duplications (chr11:110,772,110-112,514,692)\
  \ was not considered for the computation of the scaling factor.\nFor visualization\
  \ CHi-C maps of count values, difference maps, and log2 ratios were visualized with\
  \ the WashU epigenome browser (epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser/).\nGenome_build:\
