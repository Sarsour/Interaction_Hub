Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - hESC line H1
  - HindIII
  Extract-Protocol: Hi-C experiment were conducted in biological replicates using
    HindIII according to previous publication (Lieberman-Aiden, E. et al. Comprehensive
    mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.
    Science 326, 289-93 (2009).).
  Growth-Protocol: 'mESC line J1 was maintained on mitomycin C-inactivated MEF feeder
    layers in DME containing 15% fetal calf serum, leukemia inhibiting factor, penicillin/streptomycin,
    L-glutamine and non-essential amino acids. All ES cells were passaged on 0.2 %
    gelatin twice to deplete feeder cells before harvest for experiments. H1 and IMR90
    cells were grown as described in: Hawkins, R.D. et al. Distinct epigenomic landscapes
    of pluripotent and lineage-committed human cells. Cell Stem Cell 6, 479-91'

  hic.summary.txt:The paired-end Hi-C reads were mapped to mouse genome build mm9
  and human genome hg18 using an in-house pipeline based on BWA using default parameter.
  BWA SAMPE was used to merged the pairs. Duplicated reads from the same biological
  library were removed.
