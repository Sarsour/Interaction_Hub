  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes,\
    \ lysed and nuclei were isolated. Isolated nuclei were digested with 4-cutter\
    \ FastDigest MboI (Thermo Scientific, 1\xB5l/\xB5g DNA) for 4 hours at 37 \xB0\
    C. The ends of digested material were filled with biotinylated dATP, dGTP, dCTP\
    \ and dTTP using Klenow fragment (Fermentas, 0.1 U per 1 \xB5g DNA).  Klenow was\
    \ deactivated using 0.01 M EDTA at incubating 75 \xB0C for 15 minutes. Then the\
    \ material was diluted to 3.5 ng/\xB5l and ligated using T4 DNA Ligase (Promega).\
    \ The crosslinking was reversed by adding Proteinase K and incubating overnight\
    \ at 65 \xB0C. The proteins were removed and DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform\
    \ followed by ethanol precipitation. Biotinylated but unligated ends were removed\
    \ using T4 DNA polymerase by incubating at 12 \xB0C for 15 minutes. The material\
    \ was fragmented to 300-600 bases by sonication. The fragment ends were repaired\
    \ and A-tailed. Then the biotinylated fragments were bound to streptavidin beads\
    \ and unbound fragments were washed away. Sequencing adapters were then ligated\
    \ to the fragments bound to beads. The material was amplified 6-9 cycles while\
    \ bound to beads to obtain sufficient amount for sequence capture. Original biotinylated\
    \ material was removed, supernatant was hybridized to sequence capture probe set\
    \ according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche Nimblegen Inc.). Hybridized\
    \ material was washed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and amplified\
    \ with PCR for 3-6 cycles. Hybridization of the probes to the Hi-C material was\
    \ done exactly according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche Nimblegen\
    \ Inc).\nLibraries were prepared for sequencing using Illumina TruSeq protocol"
  Growth-Protocol: "Mouse  embryonic stem cells (line R1) were obtained from Janet\
    \ Rossant\u2019s lab (Toronto, Canada). Cells were maintained on 0.1% gelatin-coated\
    \ dishes in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal\
    \ calf serum (FCS), 0.1 mM non- essential amino acids, 0.3 mg/ml L-glutamine,\
    \ 1 mM pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1000 U/ml murine LIF (Chemicon International ESGRO),\
    \ and were kept in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 \xB0C. The medium of undifferentiated\
    \ cells was changed daily."

Data-Processing: 'Mapping of reads. Paired-end sequences were aligned to the mouse
  genome (build mm9) through the tool HiCUP (Babraham Bioinformatics). We then used
  custom scripts to pair the independently mapped sequence ends and we indexed each
  sequence pair to their corresponding MboI restriction fragment.

  Calling of interactions. We called significant interactions for all promoter containing
  restriction fragments. To this end, aligned pairs of which at least one mate mapping
  on a promoter were selected. Promoter regions were defined as 1000 bases downstream
  and 3000 bases upstream of transcription start site. The extension allowed mappings
  involving the directly surrounding fragment of the promoter-anchored fragment to
  be incorporated into analyses, as restriction cut efficiency was only 71%. Nonetheless,
  in 77% of interactions detected in first HiCap replicate and 92% of interactions
  detected in the second HiCap replicate, all reads mapped to sequence capture probes.
  We collected all paired sequences with one end originating from a promoter region
  and the other end at least 1000 bp away from the promoter region. Next we counted
  the occurrence of interactions to all MboI restriction fragments in the genome from
  each captured promoter region. Read pairs with the exact same mapping positions
  were discarded (to remove any potential effect from PCR duplicates). The same procedure
  was applied to the negative control regions to obtain read pairs for interactions
  that were later used as background interaction probabilities. We binned all negative
  control interactions distances (bin size of 1kb) and calculated the average and
  standard deviation of the number of interactions found per fragment for negative
  control regions (discarding fragments with zero interactions from the calculations).
  These background probabilities of interactions were then used to assess whether
  each promoter-anchored interaction was significant in each biological replicate
  independently, using a Z-test. We adjusted the P-values, to account for the multiple
  tests performed, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and we required a significant
  interaction to have adjusted P-values below 0.2 in both biological replicates, resulting
  in an effective adjusted P-value threshold of 0.04 since interactions were required
  to be present in both biological replicates. Additionally, we required at least
  4 supporting read pairs in each biological replicate. Promoter-promoter interactions
  were called similarly, but requiring that both ends of the paired reads aligned
  within the annotated promoter regions.

  Using significant promoter-enhancer interactions (read threshold 3) we generated
  a GFF files (for biological replicates separately and for replicated interactions
  between them) for visualization in Genome Browser.
