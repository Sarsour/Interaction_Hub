  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked and then lysed with nuclei permeabilized\
    \ but still intact. DNA was then restricted and the overhangs filled in incorporating\
    \ a biotinylated base. Free ends were then ligated together in situ. Crosslinks\
    \ were reversed, the DNA was sheared to 300-500bp and then biotinylated ligation\
    \ junctions were recovered with streptavidin beads.\nstandard Illumina library\
    \ construction protocol, Briefly, DNA was end-repaired using a combination of\
    \ T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and\
    \ T4 polynucleotide kinase. The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow\
    \ fragment (32 to 52 exo minus) and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for\
    \ ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the\
    \ 3\u2019 end. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers\
    \ for 8-12 cycles and library fragments of 400-600 bp (insert plus adaptor and\
    \ PCR primer sequences) were purified using SPRI beads. The purified DNA was captured\
    \ on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on\
    \ the MiSeq/HiSeq2500/HiSeqX following the manufacturer's protocols"
