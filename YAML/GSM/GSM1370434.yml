  Extract-Protocol: 'DNase Hi-C or targeted DNase Hi-C:  Cells are cross-linked with
    formaldehyde; chromatin is then randomly fragmented by DNase I. The resulting
    chromatin fragments are end-repaired and dA-tailed, then marked with a biotinylated
    internal adaptor; and proximity ligation is carried out by burying the biotin-labeled
    fragments inside solidified agarose gel to favor ligation events between the cross-linked
    DNA fragments. The resulting DNA sample contains ligation products consisting
    of chimeric DNA fragments that were originally in close spatial proximity in the
    nucleus, marked with biotin at the junction. A whole-genome chromatin interaction
    library is created by shearing the DNA and selecting the biotin-containing fragments
    with streptavidin magnetic beads. After linear library amplification, a DNase
    Hi-C library is generated and sequenced to identify whole-genome chromatin contacts.
    For targeted DNase Hi-C, the chromatin contacts associated with a specific group
    of loci of interest are then enriched by a bait library targeting the loci via
    in-solution hybridization-based DNA capture. Finally, quantitation of the enriched
    chromatin interactions is achieved through massively parallel deep sequencing.

  Growth-Protocol: Two cell lines, namely, human embryonic stem cell H1 and human
    erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell K562, were grown under standard culture conditions
    and harvested at log phase.

Data-Processing: 'First, we performed an exhaustive search and cleaning of the Illumina
  primer and adaptor sequences in the 150 bp full-length reads and extracted the remaining
  read fragments of various lengths from 25-80 bp.

  We then mapped each end of these cleaned paired-end reads separately to the human
  genome (GRCh37/hg19 assembly, obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser) using BWA/v0.5.9.
  We only retained the reads that mapped uniquely, allowing at most 3 mismatches and
  requiring mapping quality MAPQ >= 30.

  To eliminate the bias due to the PCR duplication step, we removed redundant paired-end
  reads. We define two reads as redundant if both ends of the reads are mapped to
  identical locations in the genome.

  For targeted DNase Hi-C data we performed an additional filtering step to keep only
  the paired-end reads for which at least one end mapped to or within 150 bp from
  one of the captured target regions.
