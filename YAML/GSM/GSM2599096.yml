  Extract-Protocol: 'Total RNA was isolated from Trizol using Direct-zol RNA mini-prep
    kit (Zymo Research #R2050) with DNaseI digestion.

    DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina TruSeq ChIP
    kit (Illumina #IP-202-1012)

    Barcoded libraries (Illumina TruSeq) were then loaded onto an Illumina HiSeq 1500
    and paired-end 100-base (PE100) sequencing was performed at the Advanced Genome
    Technologies Core Massively Parallel Sequencing Facility at UVM.'
  Growth-Protocol: 'MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells were grown in DMEM: F12 (Hyclone-SH30271),
    5% (v/v) horse serum (Gibco #16050) + 10ug/ml human insulin (Sigma I-1882)+ 20ng/ml
    recombinant hEGF (Peprotech AF-100-15) + 100ng/ml Cholera toxin (Sigma C-8052)
    + 0.5 ug/ml Hydrocortisone (Sigma H-0888) Pen/Strep (Life Technologies) and Glutamine
    (Life Technologies). MCF10CA1a cells were grown in DMEM: F12 (Hyclone-SH30271)
    + 5% (v/v) horse serum (Gibco #16050) +Pen/Strep (Life Technologies)and Glutamine
    (Life Technologies)  .'
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Homo sapiens
  Source: mammary gland/breast epithelial cell
  Treatment-Protocol: 'Cells were seeded at 1x106 cells per 100 mm dish and grown
    to 80-90% confluence. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
    fixed with 1% methanol free formaldehyde, and pellets stored at -80C. Hi-C was
    performed as previously published (belton, 2012, PMCID: PMC3874846).'
