Accession: GSM1055803
Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - "TNF-\u03B1 (10ng/mL) 1hr"
  - Hi-C
  - 'no'
  - HindIII
  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were conducted in biological replicates using
    HindIII according to previous publication (Lieberman-Aiden, E. et al. Comprehensive
    mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome.
    Science 326, 289-93 (2009).).  ChIP-seq protocol can be found from http://bioinformatics-renlab.ucsd.edu/RenLabLibraryProtocolV1.pdf.
    GRO-seq experiments were performed according to previous publication (Wang, D.
    et al. Reprogramming transcription by distinct classes of enhancers functionally
    defined by eRNA. Nature 474, 390-4 (2011).).

    Libraries were prepared according to Illumina''s instruction or cited literatures.'
  Growth-Protocol: 'IMR90 cells were grown as described in: Hawkins, R.D. et al. Distinct
    epigenomic landscapes of pluripotent and lineage-committed human cells. Cell Stem
    Cell 6, 479-91'
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Homo sapiens
  Source: fetal lung fibroblast
  Treatment-Protocol: "Untreated or IMR90 cells treated with TNF-\u03B1 (R&D Systems,\
    \ 10 ng/mL, 1 hr) or flavopiridol (Sigma, 1 \u03BCM for 1 hr for ChIP-seq experiments,\
    \ and 1 \u03BCM for 2 hr for Hi-C experiments) were used."

Data-Processing: 'The paired-end Hi-C reads were mapped to human genome hg18 using
  BOWTIE. Only first 36 bases were used for mapping when reads is longer. The two
  reads were mapped independently and then merged into pairs using in-house script.
  Duplicated read pairs from the same biological library were removed.

  For GRO-seq, the first round of mapping used the first 36 bases; the unmapped reads
  were then mapped in two additional iterations using first 30 or 25 bases.

  For ChIP-Seq, first 36 bases of each read were used for mapping.

  Genome_build: NCBI36

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Mapped non-redundant reads for GRO-seq and
  ChIP-seq are in BED format. Mapped non-redundant read pairs for Hi-C are in txt
  format.'
