  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C in S2 or clone8 cells was carried out as described (Belton
    et al., 2012) with a few modifications to account for Drosophila cell and genome
    size: 50 million fixed insect cells per sample were used and batches of 20 million
    cells each were digested with 400U HindIII as Hi-C samples with a control 3C sample
    of 10 million cells. Cohesive ends in Hi-C samples were filled in with dATP, dGTP,
    dTTP and biotin-14-dCTP. Then DNA was ligated, purified and sonicated. Size selection
    for ~230bp fragments carried out and then enriched for biotinylated specimen with
    straptavidin beads. Illumina paired-end adapters and PfuUltra II Fusion DNA polymerase
    were used for S2 library generation while TruSeq adapters and Q5 DNA polymerase
    were used for clone8 samples. For all libraries 10 cycles of PCR amplification
    were used.

    50 million S2 cells were collected and resuspended in 22.5ml of fresh medium.
    Clone8 cells were washed with PBS and 22.5ml of fresh medium added. 37% formaldehyde
    solution was added to obtain a final concetration of 1%, followed by incubation
    at room temperature for 10min. 1.25ml 2.5M glycine solution was added and incubated
    for another 5 min at RT followed by 10min on ice.'
  Growth-Protocol: "S2 cells were cultured in Schneider\u2019s medium (Gibco) supplemented\
    \ with 10% FCS and 0.05% Pluronic F-68 (Sigma-Aldrich) on shaking incubators at\
    \ 27\xB0C at a density of 2-16 million/ml. Clone8 (cl.8+) cells were grown in\
    \ Shields and Sang M3 Insect Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% FCS,\
    \ 5\xB5g/ml insulin and 2.5% fly extract on 15cm cell culture dishes."

Data-Processing: 'Basecalls performed using Illumina bcl2fastq 1.8.3

  Each mate file  was mapped using Bowtie2 adding the --local parameter to accommodate
  for reads containing a ligation site.

  All reads that mapped multiple times to the genome were discarded as well as read
  pairs that were less than 500 bp apart. Only reads having a mapping quality of at
  least 20 were considered. Hi-C matrices of different bin sizes were created by counting
  the number of times a Hi-C pair connected any two bins. The bin sizes considered
  were: 10,000 bp, 25,000 bp, 50,000 bp and 100,000 bp. Replicates were merged into
  one dataset. Merged matrices of Hi-C corrected counts replicates for each cell type
  were used to compute boundary points as reported in the study publication.

  Hi-C contact counts for different bin resolution and .bed files with the genomic
  coordinates of boundaries.'
