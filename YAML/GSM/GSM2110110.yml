  Extract-Protocol: "7.5 million cells were fixed for 10 or 15 minutes by resuspending\
    \ cell pellet in 7.5 ml full culture medium supplemented with 1% or 2% formaldehyde\
    \ (Sigma), respectively. The reaction was quenched by addition of 2M glycine to\
    \ a final concentration of 0.2 M and incubation for 5 minutes at room temperature\
    \ on a rocker. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 minutes at\
    \ 4\xB0C, washed by resuspension in 1 ml of PBS, pelleted and resuspended in 1\
    \ ml of PBS again. 1.9 mln cells from each sample were taken, the rest were snap-frozen\
    \ for other experiments. The samples were pelleted again, then resuspended in\
    \ 300 \u03BCl of cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40\
    \ substitute (Sigma), 1\xD7 Halt\u2122 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific))\
    \ and incubated on ice for at least 15 minutes. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation\
    \ at 2,500g for 5 minutes, resuspended in 500 \xB5l of lysis buffer and pelleted\
    \ again. The pellet was resuspended in 50 \u03BCl 0.3% SDS in NEBuffer 3 and incubated\
    \ at 62\xB0C for 10 minutes. Then the suspension was diluted with 145 \u03BCl\
    \ of 1\xD7 NEBuffer 3, 12.5 \u03BCl mQ and 12.5 \u03BCl of 20% Triton X-100 and\
    \ incubated at 37\xB0C for 1 hour to quench SDS. 30 \xB5l were taken as a chromatin\
    \ integrity control. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000g for 5\
    \ minutes, resuspended in 250 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 DpnII buffer (NEB) with 600 U DpnII\
    \ enzyme (NEB), and the chromatin was digested overnight (14-16 hours) at 37\xB0\
    C with rotation. In the morning 200 more units were added and the cells were incubated\
    \ for additional 2 hours. DpnII was inactivated by incubation at 65\xB0C for 20\
    \ minutes. 40 \u03BCl was taken as a digestion control, 40 \u03BCl of mQ were\
    \ added to the sample. The ends were filled-in by addition of 50 \u03BCl fill-in\
    \ mix (36 ul mQ, 1.5 \u03BCl of 10 mM biotin-14-CTP, 1.5 \u03BCl of 10 mM dATP,\
    \ 1.5 \u03BCl of 10 mM dGTP, 1.5 \u03BCl of 10 mM dTTP, 8 \u03BCl of 5 U/\u03BC\
    l DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (NEB)) and incubation at 37\xB0C for\
    \ 1.5 hours. Then 900 \u03BCl of ligation mix (712 \u03BCl water, 120 \u03BCl\
    \ 10\xD7 NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB), 50 \u03BCl 20% Triton X-100, 12 \u03BC\
    l 10 mg/ml BSA (NEB), 6 \u03BCl 5 U/\u03BCl T4 DNA Ligase (Thermo Scientific))\
    \ were added to the sample. The sample was mixed by inversion and incubated with\
    \ rotation for 4 hours at room temperature. Then the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation\
    \ at 3,000g for 10 minutes and resuspended in 200 \u03BCl mQ. Proteins were degraded\
    \ by addition of 15 \u03BCl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K and 20 \u03BCl of 10% SDS\
    \ and incubation at 55\xB0C for 30 minutes. Then 130 \u03BCl 5M NaCl were added\
    \ and the samples were incubated at 65\xB0C overnight (14-16 hours). The DNA was\
    \ ethanol precipitated and then dissolved in 500 \u03BCl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,\
    \ washed twice on Amicon 30K filter units (Millipore) with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0\
    \ and then eluted into a clean tube. The volume was adjusted to 500 \u03BCl with\
    \ sonication buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) and the samples were sonicated\
    \ using VirSonic 100 (Virtis) with power setting 15 for 15 seconds twice with\
    \ 1 minute interval. Samples were washed twice again using Amicon 30K filter units\
    \ (Millipore). All consecutive steps until PCR were performed in LoBind tubes\
    \ (Eppendorf). 30 \xB5l of 10 mg/ml Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Life\
    \ technologies) were prepared for biotin pull-down by washing with 80 \xB5l of\
    \ 1\xD7 TWB (1\xD7 Tween Washing Buffer, 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1\
    \ M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Then the beads were resuspended in 60 \u03BCl of 2\xD7\
    \ BB (2\xD7 Binding Buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl) and added\
    \ to the samples; the suspension was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature\
    \ with rotation. After that the beads were used for library preparation.\nThe\
    \ library preparation was done by the VBCF NGS unit (vbcf.ac.at) following the\
    \ standard DNA sample  preparation protocol for Solexa platforms (NEB reagents)."

  Mapping: iterative mapping (see Imakaev et al, 2012) using bowtie2 with increased
  stringency parameters: --score-min -L 0.6,0.2--very-  sensitive

  Read filtering: if two reads map to the same strands, and each side of the read
  is within 500 bp of any side of the other read, we retained only one copy of the
  read.

  Additional filtering: we separated the genome into 500 bp bins. If any two bins
  were interacting more than once, only one interaction was counted. Since each region
  is only present in the single cell up to 4 times (in oocytes), we eliminated all
  500 bp bins that form more than 8 unique interactions with other bins.

  Filtered reads were then binned at different resolutions (we provide files at 200Kb
  resolution) using read start as a read position. No normalization was applied to
  the data.
