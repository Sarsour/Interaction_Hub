  Extract-Protocol: The Hi-C libraries were prepared as previously described (PMID:22652625).
  Growth-Protocol: "MCF-10A cells were obtained from the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer\
    \ Institute (Detroit, MI). The cells were maintained in monolayer in Dulbecco's\
    \ modified Eagle's medium-F12 (DMEM/F12) (Invitrogen, 21041025) supplemented with\
    \ 5% horse serum (Invitrogen, 16050122), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen,\
    \ 15140122), 0.5 \u03BCg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma, H-0888), 100 ng/ml cholera\
    \ toxin (Sigma, C-8052), 10 \u03BCg/ml insulin (Sigma, I-1882), and 20 ng/ml recombinant\
    \ human EGF (Peprotech, 100-15) as previously described (Debnath et al. 2003).\
    \  MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM supplemented\

Data-Processing: "Library strategy:\nThe Hi-C data were mapped with Bowtie and  binned\
  \ at 6.5Mb, 1Mb, 250kb, 100kb and 40kb non-overlapping genomic intervals.  Iterative\
  \ mapping and correction of Hi-C data were performed as previously described (Imakaev\
  \ et al. 2012).  Biological replicates showed high reproducibility (Pearson's correlation\
  \ coefficient > 0.9 for 1Mb resolution data).  Similarly, the first eigenvector\
  \ comparison of the replicates showed high reproducibility.  For the downstream\
  \ analyses, sequences obtained from both biological replicates were pooled and ICE-corrected\
  \ to serve as a combined dataset.\nCompartment analysis: First, the z-scores of\
  \ the interaction matrices at 250kb resolution were generated as described previously\
  \ (Lieberman, 2009).  Then, Pearson Correlation on the Z-score matrices was calculated.\
  \  By performing principal component analysis (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009; Zhang\
  \ et al. 2012), the first eigenvector typically represents the compartment profile(Lieberman-Aiden\
  \ et al. 2009), where the positive and negative 1st eigenvalues represent different\
  \ compartments.   Gene density for each compartment was calculated to call the \u201C\
  A\u201D and \u201CB\u201D compartmentalization.\nTAD Calling: TAD calling was performed\
  \ as calculating the \u201Cinsulation\u201D score of each bin using the 40kb resolution\
  \ combined Hi-C data (as previously described.  The mean of the interactions across\
  \ each bin were calculated.  By sliding a 1Mb x 1Mb (25bins x 25bins) square along\
  \ the diagonal of the interaction matrix for every chromosome, we obtained the \u201C\
  insulation score\u201D of the interaction matrix.  Valleys in the insulation score\
  \ indicated the depletion of Hi-C interactions occurring across a bin.  These 40kb\
  \ valleys represent the TAD boundaries.  Based on the variation of boundaries between\
  \ replicates, we chose to add a total of 160kb (80kb to each side) to the boundary\
  \ to account for replicate variation.  The final boundaries span a 200kb region.\
  \ All boundaries with a boundary strength < 0.15 were excluded as they were considered\
  \ weak and non-reproducible.  The insulation plots for the biological replicates\
  \ showed high reproducibility (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.80 for MCF-7\
  \ and 0.90 for MCF-10A replicates), suggesting the robustness of the method.  Similarly,\
  \ the overlap of detected boundaries also showed high reproducibility between the\
  \ biological replicates (~85% TAD boundary overlap for MCF-7 and ~91% for MCF-10A).\
  \  Therefore, we used the combined Hi-C replicates for the TAD analyses.\nZ-Score\
  \ Calculation: We modeled the overall Hi-C decay with distance using a modified\
  \ LOWESS method (alpha = 1%, IQR filter), as described previously (Sanyal et al.\
  \ 2012).  LOWESS calculates the weighted-average and weighted-standard deviation\
  \ for every genomic distance and therefore normalizes for genomic distance signal\
  \ bias.\nGenome_build: hg19\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content: Hi-C: tar ball\
