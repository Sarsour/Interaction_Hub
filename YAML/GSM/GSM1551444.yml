  Characteristics: Kc167 Drosophila Embryonic Cell line
  Extract-Protocol: "Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room\
    \ temperature.  Crosslinking was quenched with glycine and nuclear lysates were\
    \ incubated with HindIII or DpnII. Fragment ends were filled with biotinylated\
    \ nucleotides, ligated. After reverssion of crosslinks, DNA was purified, sonicated\
    \ and used to make Illumina libraries\nTo generate sequencing libraries, ChIP\
    \ DNA was prepared for adaptor ligation by end repair (\u2018End-It DNA End Repair\
    \ Kit\u2019\_ - Epicentre Cat# ER0720) and addition of \u2018A\u2019 base to 3\u2019\
    \ ends (Klenow 3\u2019-5\u2019 exo- NEB Cat# M0212S). Illumina adaptors (Illumina\
    \ Cat# PE-102-1001) were titrated according to prepared DNA ChIP sample concentration,\
    \ and ligated with T4 ligase (NEB Cat# M0202S). Ligated ChIP samples were PCR\
    \ amplified using Illumina primers\_ and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB Cat# F-530L)\
    \ and size selected for 200-300bp by gel extraction."
  Growth-Protocol: Kc cells were maintained in HyClone CCM3 Serum-free media.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Drosophila melanogaster
  Source: Kc167
  Treatment-Protocol: For triptolide and flavopiridol samples, cells were treated
    with 10 mM triptolide or 1 mM flavopiridol for 3 h

Data-Processing: "Library strategy: Hi-C\nHi-C reads were aligned using Bowtie 0.12.7\
  \ with default parameters and \u201C-m 1\u201D\nPCR duplicate reads were removed\n\
  GC content, mappability, and fragment length effects were normalized as described\
  \  in Hou et al., Molecular Cell 48, 471-484 (2012).\nGenome_build: dm3\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content:\
  \ Hi-C processed files are in a modified bed format. Each row lists the chromosome\
  \ and the start and end coordinates of two interacting bins as well as the normalized\
  \ interaction frequency between these two bins"
