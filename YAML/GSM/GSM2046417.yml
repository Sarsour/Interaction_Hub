  Extract-Protocol: "The methods for Hi-C library construction were adopted from (Belton\
    \ JM, McCord RP, Gibcus JH, Naumova N, Zhan Y, Dekker J. Hi-C: a comprehensive\
    \ technique to capture the conformation of genomes. Methods 2012). For each Hi-C\
    \ library, ~20*106 cells were resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM\
    \ Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Igpel, 10 mL protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated\
    \ on ice for 15 min. Cells were homogenized on ice. Cells were collected by spinning\
    \ for 5 minutes at 2,000 xg, then washed twice in 500 mL of ice cold 1x NEB buffer\
    \ 2. Cells were distributed between 4 centrifuge tubes. Chromatins in each tube\
    \ were digested with 400u of restriction enzyme HindIII in 1x NEB buffer 2 at\
    \ 37 C overnight on a spin wheel. After HindIII digestion, restriction site overhanging\
    \ ends were filled and labeled with biotin with DNA polymerase I large (Klenow)\
    \ fragments in a reaction containing dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and biotin-14-dCTP in each\
    \ of the 4 Hind III digestion tube. DNA fragments labeled biotin-14-dCTP from\
    \ each of the 4 tubes were ligated at 16 C for 4 hours in an 8.23 mL reaction\
    \ containing 1x ligation buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml Bovine serum albumin\
    \ (BSA),10 mM ATP, and 50u T4 DNA ligase . Reverse cross-linking started with\
    \ 50 ml of 10 mg/ml proteinase K added to each tube and incubated at 65 C for\
    \ 4 hours. Then, another 50 ml of proteinase K were added to each tube and continued\
    \ incubating at 65 C overnight. Next, DNA was extracted with saturated phenolchloroform\
    \ (1:1) and desalted by using AMICON! Ultra Centrifugal Filter with 1 x TE buffer.\
    \ The final volume of desalted DNA was adjusted to 100 mL in 1 x TE buffer. Removal\
    \ of Biotin from un-ligated ends was carried out in 8 individual reactions each\
    \ of 50 mL containing 5 mg of Hi-C 405 DNA, 1 mg/ml BSA,1X NEB buffer 2, 25 nM\
    \ dATP, 25 nM dGTP, and 15u T4 DNA polymerase at 20 C for 4 hours. The Hi-C DNA\
    \ was then pooled in a single tube, purified with single phenol extraction, and\
    \ precipitated by ethanol. The DNA was re-dissolved in 105 ml of water, and transferred\
    \ to a microTUBE AFA tube.\nDNA fragmentation was performed in a Sonicator. The\
    \ DNA fragments of 200 \u2013 400 bp were recovered with Agencourt AMPure XP mixture.\
    \ DNA fragment ends were repaired in a 70 mL reaction containing 1X ligation buffer,\
    \ 0.25 mM of dNTP mixture, 7.5 u of T4 DNA polymerase, 25u of T4 polynucleotide\
    \ kinase, 2.5u of DNA polymerase I large fragment at 20 C for 30 min. The reaction\
    \ was purified with a MinElute column. The DNA was eluted in 32 mL of elusion\
    \ buffer for A-tailing, which was performed in a 50 mL reaction containing 5 mg\
    \ DNA, 1X NEB buffer 2, 0.2 mM dATP, 15u Klenow fragment. The reaction was incubated\
    \ at 37 C for 30 min, then at 65 C for 20 min. For Streptavidin pull-down, the\
    \ biotinylated Hi-C products were mixed with MyOne C1 streptavidin bead solution.\
    \ Non-specifically binding DNA was removed by washing with 1X binding buffer (5\
    \ mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 435 1 M NaCl, then with 1X T4 Ligation\
    \ buffer). The DNA-bound beads were resuspended in 38.75 ml of 1 X ligation buffer\
    \ for adapter ligation. Illumina adapter ligation was performed in a 50 mL reaction\
    \ by adding to the DNA-bound beads suspension of 1X T4 ligation buffer, 90 pM\
    \ of Illumina paired end adapter, 3u of T4 DNA ligase. The reaction was incubated\
    \ at room temperature for 2 hours. The beads were reclaimed, and the supernatant\
    \ discarded. The beads were washed twice in Tween Wash Buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0,\
    \ 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), once in 1X binding buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl\
    \ (pH8.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl, and twice in 1 X NEB buffer 2. After the\
    \ last wash, the beads were resuspended in 20 ml of 1X NEB buffer 2. The Hi-C\
    \ DNA sample was amplified by 15 PCR cycles for Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Each\
    \ PCR reaction in 25 ml, 1.5 ml of Bead-bound Hi-C DNA, 0.35 ml of PE primer 1.0,\
    \ 0.35 ml of PE primer 2.0, 0.2 ml of 25 mM dNTP, 2.5 ml of 10X PfuUltra buffer,\
    \ 19.6 ml of H2O, and 0.5 ml of PfuUltra Fusion DNA polymerase. The PCR cycling\
    \ parameters were 98 C for 30 seconds, followed by 15 cycles at 98 C for 10 seconds,\
    \ 65 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for 30 seconds, and a final extension at 72 C\
    \ for 7 minutes. PCR products pooled from the supernatant of multiple reactions\
    \ were subjected to AMpure XP beads purification to remove primer dimers. Each\
    \ Hi-C library that passed the QC procedure was then sequenced in a single lane\
    \ of a flow cell on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer to generate paired-end sequence reads\
    \ at 100 bases per end read."
  Growth-Protocol: "Human foreskin fibroblasts from a normal karyotyped male individual\
    \ (Cat # CRL-2522, ATCC) were propagated in growth medium, composed of MEM medium\
    \ (cat # 11095\u2013098, Life Technologies), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, cat\
    \ # 10082\u2013147), 1 X non-essential amino acids (NEAA, cat # 11140\u2013050,\
    \ Life Technologies), and 1 X antibiotic/antimycotic (cat # 15240\u2013062, Life\
    \ Technologies).\L"

  Treatment-Protocol: "Fibroblasts were synchronized to G0/G1\Lwith serum-free MEM\
    \ supplemented with 1X NEAA and 1X Antibiotic/antimycomic for 48 hours. Synchronized\
    \ cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin to suspend for replating. For 2D monolayer\
    \ cultures, 4*106 cells were plated in each 150 mm dish. For 3D cultures, 0.5*106\
    \ cells were plated in each well of a 96-well PERFECTA3D Hanging Drop Plate (3D\
    \ Biomatrix). All cultures were incubated for 48 hours in growth medium at 37\
    \ C with 5% CO2. Approximately 20*106 cells grown in 2D were cross linked with\
    \ 1% formaldehyde in serum free-medium for 15 min at room temperature, and then\
    \ quenched with glycine to a final concentration of 0.128 M. Spheroids were harvested\
    \ in serum-free medium, and crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde for 30 min at room\
    \ temperature. The cross linking reaction was quenched with the glycine to a final\
    \ concentration of 0.128 M. Cross linked cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen\
    \ then stored at 80 C until the construction of Hi-C libraries."
