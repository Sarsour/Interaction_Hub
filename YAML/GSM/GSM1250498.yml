  Extract-Protocol: 'Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Chromatin was
    digested with HindIII (NEB, Ipswich, MA). DNA ends of digested chromatin were
    marked by biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following blunt-end ligation
    with T4 DNA ligase in diluted condition. Ligated DNA was then de-crosslinked and
    purified by phenol extraction procedures. Biotin-14-dCTP at non-ligated DNA ends
    was removed with exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase. Ligated DNA was then
    applied to paired-end sequencing by using the Illumina sequencing technology platform
    (Genome Analyzer IIx, Illumina).

    Sample preparation for paired-end sequencing was performed following the manufacturer''s
    instructions. Briefly, ligated DNA (5 microg) was sheared to a size of 300-500
    basepairs by a nebulizer supplied with the Illumina paired-end sample preparation
    kit. Fragmented DNA was end-paired using T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow polymerase
    with T4 polynucleotide kinase to phosphorylate the 5'' ends.  A 3'' overhang was
    created using a 3''-5'' exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment, and then subjected
    to immunoprecipitation by Dynabeads MyOne Streptavin C1 Beads (Invitrogen) in
    DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) with ligation of Illumina paired-end
    adaptor oligonucleotides.  The ligation mixtures were electrophoresed on E-gel
    SizeSelect 2% pre-cast agarose gels (Invitrogen) to collect 250-bp fragments.
    Size-selected DNA fragments were enriched with Illumina paired-end primers by
    a 15-cycle PCR reaction. DNA samples (20 nM per sample), quantified by an Agilent
    Bioanalyzer, were loaded onto the paired-end flowcell of Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx)
    in the supplied cluster station according to the manufacturer''s protocol. Clusters
    of PCR colonies were then sequenced on GAIIx with 51-bp per read.'
  Growth-Protocol: MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, obtained from the American Type
    Culture Collection, was maintained in phenol red-free medium.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Homo sapiens

  Treatment-Protocol: 'After 48 hours of hormone deprivation in 5% charcoal-dextran
    stripped serum media (no phenol red), cells were stimulated with 70 nM estrogen
    (E2) for various times: before (0) or after 0.5, 1, 4 and 24 hours of stimulation.'
