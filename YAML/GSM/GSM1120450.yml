  Growth-Protocol: 'Caulobacter crescentus were grown as described previously in Skerker
    et al., 2005 (PMID: 16176121). When appropriate, media were supplemented with
    antibiotics at the following concentrations (liquid/solid media) [ug/ml]): chloramphenicol
    (1/2), kanamycin (5/25), oxytetracycline (1/2), spectinomycin (25/100). Synchronizations
    were performed on mid-exponential phase cells using Percoll (GE Healthcare) and
    density gradient centrifugation as described previously in Jones et al., 2001
    (PMID: 11283290). After synchronization, swarmer cells were released into PYE
    for 0, 10, 30, 60, 75 or 150 minutes before fixing with formadehyde for chromosome
    conformation capture and Hi-C analysis. For antibiotic treatments, swarmer cells
    were incubated with 25 ug/mL or 50 ug/mL novobiocin (final concentration) or 25
    ug/ml rifampicin (final concentration) for 30 minutes before fixing with formadehyde.'

  Paired-end sequencing reads were mapped independently to the genome of Caulobacter
  crescentus CB15N (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_011916.1) using Bowtie 2.1.0 and an
  algorithm which iteratively increases truncation length to maximize yield of valid
  Hi-C interactions (Imakaev et al., 2012. PMID: 22941365). Only read pairs with both
  reads that were uniquely aligned to the genome were considered for subsequent steps.

  The Caulobacter CB15N genome was then divided into restriction fragments (700 BglII
  fragments and 2025 NcoI fragments). Each read of a read pair was sorted into its
  corresponding restriction fragment. Read pairs were classified as valid Hi-C products,
  non-ligation, or self-ligation products; only valid Hi-C products were considered
  below.

  To create interaction matrices, the Caulobacter genome was first divided into 405
  10-kb bins. We then assigned valid Hi-C products to the bins as follows. Recall
  that each valid Hi-C product involves the ligation of two restriction fragments.
  If both restriction fragments are contained entirely within bins (e.g. suppose fragment
  1 is contained within bin A and fragment 2 is contained within bin B), we incremented
  the count of interactions between bins A and B by one. If one of the restriction
  fragments spanned two bins (e.g. suppose fragment 1 is contained within bin A but
  fragment 2 spans bins B and C) then we incremented the count of interactions between
  bin A and B by an amount proportional to the fraction of fragment 2 that overlaps
  bin B (and similarly for the count of interactions between A and C). Thus, each
  read contributes a count of one to the interaction map, but it can be split between
  bins. This means of assigning reads to bins was necessary to analyze data at a high
  10-kb resolution. Interactions of a bin with itself, and with neighboring bins were
  discarded, as in Imakaev et al., 2012. For the presentation of the matrices, three
  discarded diagonals were later given the maximal cut-off value of 0.035.

  Raw Hi-C contact maps can be biased due to the uneven distribution of restriction
  enzyme sites and, to a lesser extent, differences in GC content and the mappability
  of individual reads. We therefore normalized raw contact maps using an iterative
  normalization procedure, implemented using the hiclib library for Python (https://bitbucket.org/mirnylab/hiclib).
  Essentially, we converted the number of interactions, or read counts, into Hi-C
  scores by applying the following equation and iteratively repeating it for the resulting
  contact map after each cycle: mij =mij * (total reads) / (total reads in bin i *
  total reads in bin j). Iterative procedure was repeated until the maximum relative
  error of the total number of Hi-C scores in a bin was less than 1e-5. Resulting
  matrices were normalized so that Hi-C scores for each row and column sum to 1. Subsequent
  analysis and visualization was done using Python and R scripts.
