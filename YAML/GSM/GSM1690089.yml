  Extract-Protocol: "Hi-C experiment was performed as described previously (Belton\
    \ et al. 2012) with minor modifications that are described below. 3-5 millions\
    \ of cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of 1\xD7 PBS (10 mM phosphate\
    \ buffer, 2.7 mM KCI, 137 mM NaCI, pH7.4) and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma)\
    \ for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 M glycine\
    \ to a final concentration of 125 mM. Cell suspension was incubated on ice for\
    \ 5 min, and then cells were pelleted (10 min at 1000 g in pre-chilled (4C) centrifuge).\
    \ The supernatant was removed, the cell pellet was washed with 500 \u03BCl of\
    \ 1X PBS and then frozen and, if necessary, stored in a liquid nitrogen. After\
    \ thawing the cells were lysed for 15 min in 1.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50\
    \ mM Tris-HCI (pH8.0), 150 mM NaCI, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40, 1% (v/v) Triton-X100, 1\xD7\
    \ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (CALBIOCHEM #539137 of Thermo Scientific #78430)).\
    \ The nuclei were harvested at 5000 g for 7 min in pre-chilled centrifuge, washed\
    \ twice with 100 \u03BCl of 1.2\xD7 restriction NEBuffer 2 (NEB) and resuspended\
    \ in 200 \u03BCl of 1.2\xD7 NEBuffer 2. 20% SDS was added to a final concentration\
    \ of 0.3%, and nuclei were incubated at 37C for 1h with constant shaking. After\
    \ incubation, 330 \u03BCl of 1.2\xD7 NEBuffer 2 were added, 20% Triton X-100 was\
    \ added to a final concentration of 1.8%, and samples were incubated for 1h in\
    \ the same conditions. DNA was digested overnight with 600-800 U of 100 U/\u03BC\
    l HindIII-HF restriction endonuclease (NEB) at 37C with shaking. Next morning,\
    \ 200 U of HindIII-HF were added and samples were incubated for 2h in the same\
    \ conditions. Nuclei were harvested at 5000 g for 10 min at 25C and resuspended\
    \ in 50 \u03BCl of the collected supernatant. Cohesive DNA ends were biotinylated\
    \ by adding 7.6 \u03BCl of the biotin fill-in mixture prepared in 1\xD7 NEBuffer\
    \ 2 (0.025 mM dATP (Thermo Scientific), 0.025 mM dGTP (Thermo Scientific), 0.025\
    \ mM dTTP (Thermo Scientific), 0.025 mM biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen), 0.8 U/ul\
    \ Klenow enzyme (NEB)). Samples were incubated at 37C for 75 min with slow shaking,\
    \ then 20% SDS was added to a final concentration of 1.8%, and samples were heated\
    \ at 65C for 20 min to inactivate Klenow enzyme and residual HindIII-HF. The samples\
    \ were transferred into 10-ml tubes with 3 ml of 1\xD7 T4 DNA ligase reaction\
    \ buffer (Thermo Scientific) supplied with 1.8% Triton X-100, incubated at 37C\
    \ for 1h and then cooled on ice. Next, 100 U of T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific)\
    \ was added and the DNA was ligated for 6 h at 22C with slow agitation. The cross-links\
    \ were reversed by incubation at 65C overnight in the presence of proteinase K\
    \ (100 ug/ml). After cross-link reversal, DNA was purified by single phenol-chloroform\
    \ extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (tRNA (Sigma) at a concentration\
    \ of 7.5 ug/ml and glycogen (Thermo Scientific) at a concentration of 20 ug/ml\
    \ were used as co-precipitators due to a low amount of DNA in the samples). After\
    \ precipitation, the pellets was dissolved in 500 \u03BCl 10 mM Tris-HCI pH8.0,\
    \ and DNA was additionally purified to remove residual salts and DTT on AMICON\
    \ Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (0.5 ml, 30K, Millipore #UFC5030BK) by washing\
    \ with 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0 (after two washing steps the final volume of the\
    \ DNA solution was 40-50 \u03BCl). Biotinylated nucleotides from non-ligated DNA\
    \ ends were removed by incubation of Hi-C libraries in the presence of 1.5 U of\
    \ T4 DNA polymerase (NEB) in NEBuffer 2 supplied with 0.025 mM dATP and 0.025\
    \ mM dGTP at 20C for 4 h. Next, DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction\
    \ followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellets were dissolved in 500 \u03BC\
    l of sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS), the samples\
    \ were treated with 50 ug of RNAse A (Thermo Scientific) for 45 min at 37C, and\
    \ DNA was then sheared to the size of approximately 100-1000 bp using a VirSonic\
    \ 100 (VerTis). Samples were concentrated (and simultaneously purified) on AMICON\
    \ Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units. Fraction of 100-500 bp DNA fragments was captured\
    \ by using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), DNA was eluted with 50\
    \ \u03BCl of 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0).\nThe DNA ends after the sonication step\
    \ were repaired by adding 62.5 \u03BCl MQ water, 14 \u03BCl of 10\xD7 T4 DNA ligase\
    \ reaction buffer, 3.5 \u03BCl of 10 mM dNTP mix, 5 \u03BCl of 3 U/\u03BCl T4\
    \ DNA polymerase (NEB), 5 \u03BCl of 10 U/\u03BCl T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB),\
    \ 1 \u03BCl of 5 U/\u03BCl Klenow DNA polymerase (NEB) and incubating at 20C for\
    \ 30 min. DNA was purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads and eluted with 50 \u03BC\
    l of 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0). To perform an A-tailing reaction, the DNA samples\
    \ were then supplemented with 6 \u03BCl 10X NEBuffer 2, 1.2 \u03BCl of 10 mM dATP,\
    \ 1 \u03BCl of MQ water and 3.6 \u03BCl of 5 U/\u03BCl Klenow (exo-) (NEB). The\
    \ reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37C in PCR-machine and then their enzyme\
    \ was heat-inactivated by incubation at 65C for 20 min. DNA was purified using\
    \ Agencourt AMPure XP beads and eluted with 100 \u03BCl of 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH\
    \ 8.0). Biotin pull-down of the ligation junctions was performed as described\
    \ previously (Belton et al. 2012) with minor modifications. Briefly, 4 \u03BC\
    l of MyOne Dynabeads Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen) beads were used to capture biotinylated\
    \ DNA, and the volumes of all buffers were decreased by 4 times. The washed beads\
    \ with captured ligation junctions were resuspended in 50 \u03BCl of adapter ligation\
    \ mixture composed of 41.5 \u03BCl MQ water, 5 \u03BCl 10X T4 DNA ligase reaction\
    \ buffer (Thermo Scientific), 2.5 \u03BCl of Illumina TruSeq adapters and 1 \u03BC\
    l of 5 U/\u03BCl T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific). Adapter ligation was performed\
    \ at 22C for 2.5 h. Then beads were sequentially washed twice with 100 \u03BC\
    l of TWB (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20), once\
    \ with 100 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 1 mM EDTA,\
    \ 2 M NaCl) and once with 100 \u03BCl of CWB (10 mM Tris-HCI (pH8.0), 50 mM NaCI)\
    \ and then resuspended in 20 \u03BCl of MQ water. Test PCR reactions containing\
    \ 4 \u03BCl of streptavidin bound Hi-C library were performed to determine the\
    \ optimal number of PCR cycles needed to generate enough PCR products for sequencing.\
    \ PCR reactions (volume of each reaction is 25 \u03BCl) were performed using KAPA\
    \ High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (KAPA) and Illumina PE1.0 and PE2.0 PCR primers\
    \ (10 pmol each). The temperature profile was 5 min at 98C followed by 6, 9, 12,\
    \ 15 and 18 cycles of 20 s at 98C, 15 s at 65C, 20 s at 72C. The PCR reactions\
    \ were run on a 2% agarose gel supplied with ethidium bromide and the number of\
    \ PCR cycles necessary to obtain sufficient amount of DNA was determined based\
    \ on visual inspection of gels (typically 12-15 cycles). Four preparative PCR\
    \ reactions were performed for each sample. PCR mixtures were combined, PCR products\
    \ were purified with QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit. The DNA was eluted with 50 \u03BC\
    l of 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0) and was run on a 1.8% agarose gel supplied with ethidium\
    \ bromide. 200-600 bp DNA fragments were cut off the gel, purified on QIAGEN Gel\
    \ Extraction Kit and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 by paired-end 101-nt reads."
  Growth-Protocol: "S2 and Kc167 cells were grown at 25 C in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila\
    \ Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,\
    \ Gibco) and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mkg/ml streptomycin. DmBG3-c2 cells\
    \ were grown in the same conditions except that half of Schneider\u2019s Drosophila\
    \  Medium was substituted by the Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Sigma). OSC\
    \ cells were cultured in Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Sigma) supplemented\
    \ with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Gibco), 10% fly extract, 10 \xB5g/ml insulin\
    \ (Sigma), 0.6 mg/ml glutathione (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mkg/ml\
