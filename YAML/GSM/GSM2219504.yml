  - none
  Extract-Protocol: '5-10 million Haploid mouse ES cells were fixed for 5 min with
    2 % formaldehyde in PBS and then the reaction was quenched for another 5 min in
    0.125 M glycine. Nuclei were then extracted by incubating cells on ice for 30
    min (inverting every 10 min) in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2 % NP-40 (IGEPAL
    CA-630) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).

    Single cell Hi-C libraries were prepared using Illumina''s Nextera XT sample kit
    with the following modifications. Briefly, biotinylated junctions were captured
    on streptavidin M-280 dynabeads and digested with AluI enzyme. Then tagmentaion
    was carried out using 1:10 to 1:100 dilution of Amplicon Tagment Mix. After tagmentation
    DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 9 + 15 cycles and library fragments
    of ~300-700 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were isolated using
    AMPure beads (Beckman). The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell
    for cluster generation. Libraries were sequenced on the MiSeq following the manufacturer''s
    protocols.'
  Growth-Protocol: 'All mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were cultured on 0.2 %
    gelatin in 2i media (NDiff B27 base medium, Stem Cell Sciences Ltd, catalogue
    no: SCS-SF-NB-02, supplemented with 1 uM PD0325901, 3 uM CHIR99021 and 20 ng/ml
    LIF). Haploid mESCs were sorted every 4 passages to enrich for haploid cells as
    previously described in Leeb M & Wutz A, Nature, 2011'

  Basecalls performed using Phred quality score (Q score)

  ChIP-seq reads were aligend to the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome reference using Bowtie
  2 v2.1.050 and filtered to retain reads with mapping quality >30.

  ChIP-seq peaks were called using MACS2 v2.1.0.2015073157 with a minimum FDR cutoff
  of 0.01 (-q 0.01), except for broad features (H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K9me3) where
  a cutoff of 0.05 was used (-q 0.05).

  ChIP-seq peaks were filtered to remove those not corresponding to the canonical
  chromosomes.

  RNA-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome GRCm38/mm10, downloaded from
  the Ensembl database ftp.ensembl.org using Gsnap version gmap-2014-12-17. Only uniquely
  mapped reads were used for further analysis. Gene counts from SAM files were obtained
  using htseq-count version 0.6.1 with mode intersection non-empty, -s reverse. The
  gene annotation was extracted from Ensembl Gene Release 75. Differential gene expression
  analysis was conducted using Bioconductor R (R-3.1.2) package DESeq2 version 1.6.3.
  An adjusted p Value threshold of 0.05 was used to determine differential gene expression.
  Expression values are FPKM (read number normalized across samples by DESeq size
  factor and across genes by gene length) calculated using custom R-scripts.

  Single cell Hi-C reads were initially processed using the NucProcessing software
  package (available upon request). Processed reads were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10
  mouse genome reference using Bowtie 2 and filtered to retain reads that formed a
  valid Hi-C contact junction between two RE1 resriction sites. Output files were
  further processed to perform extra, single-cell specific processing and cleanup.
  These remove any pairs that represent only a single observation of a specific RE1-RE1
  ligation junction after PCR amplification, while at least two separate, albeit sometimes
  identical, molecules must be paired-end sequenced to confirm a ligation junction.
  Next the sequence pairs were filtered to remove those with promiscuous ends: where
  the RE1 fragment at either end was involved in more than one ligation event. Finally,
  the redundancy in amplified RE1-RE1 ligation events was removed to create a single
  list of paired RE1 fragment ends.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: A summary table of results (.txt) from the
  analysis of the RNA-seq samples includes expression estimates for all genes (Ensembl
  Gene Release 75; GRCm38/mm10). Expression values are FPKM (read number normalized
  across samples by DESeq size factor and across genes by gene length) calculated
  using custom R-scripts.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: bed files (.bed) are tab-delimited text
  files containing chromosomal coordinates of all ChIP-seq peaks (chromosome name,
  start, end).

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Single cell Hi-C txt file (.txt) is a tab-separated
  text format containing the Hi-C contacts. After the header line, each individual
  contact is represented on a line consisting of chromosome_1 seq_pos_1 chromosome_2seq_pos_2

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Single cell genome structure pdb file (.pdb)
  is protein data bank format. Atom type N is used to indicate restrained particles.
  Atom type C is used to represent unrestrained backbone particles. Residue number
  corresponds to the particle and increases every 100 kb. Chain letter represents
  the chromosome. The last column represents the particle sequence position.

  CENP-A superposition coordinates are represented in xyz format and may be viewed
  using molecular graphics software such as PyMol. The xyz format contain centromere
  positions after fitting to the corresponding genome structure. Atom type O was used
  to represent centromere positions.

  is;name :: String -- the name of the NucFrame;bin_size :: Int -- the bin_size of
  the nuc files;chrms :: ["X", "1", ..] -- all of the chromosomes that are present;bp_pos/chrm
