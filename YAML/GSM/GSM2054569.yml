    zone (GZ).

    Tissue was fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cross-linked DNA was digested
    by restriction enzyme HindIII. Digested chromatin ends were filled and marked
    with biotin-14-dCTP. Resulting blunt-end fragments were ligated under dilute concentration
    to minimize random intermolecular ligations. DNA purified after crosslinking was
    reversed by proteinase K treatment. Biotins from unligated ends were removed by
    exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase. DNA was sheared by sonication and 300-600bp
    fragments were selected. Biotin-tagged DNA, which is intermolecular ligation products,
    was pulled down with streptavidin beads (Invitrogen, 65001), and ligated with
    Illumina paired end adapters. Resulting Hi-C library was amplified by PCR and
    sequenced by Illumina 50bp paired-end sequencing.'
