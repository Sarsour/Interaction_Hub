  Extract-Protocol: "2-4 million cells were fixed for 10 minutes by resuspending the\
    \ cell pellet in 5 ml full culture medium supplemented with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma).\
    \ The reaction was quenched by addition of 2 M glycine to a final concentration\
    \ of 125 mM and incubation for 5 minutes on ice. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation,\
    \ washed by resuspension in 1 ml of PBS and pelleted again. Then the cells were\
    \ resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer and incubated on ice for at least 15 minutes.\
    \ Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500g for 5 minutes, resuspended in\
    \ 100 \u03BCl of 1\xD7NEBuffer 3 and pelleted again. The pellet was resuspended\
    \ in 100 \u03BCl of 0.3% SDS in 1\xD7NEBuffer 3 and incubated at 37\xB0C for 1\
    \ hour. Then the suspension was diluted with 330\_\u03BCl of 1\xD7 NEBuffer 3\
    \ and 53 \u03BCl of 20% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and incubated at 37\xB0C for 1 hour\
    \ to quench SDS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000g for 5 minutes,\
    \ resuspended in 250 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 DpnII buffer (NEB). 20 \u03BCl were taken\
    \ as a chromatin integrity control, then 600 U DpnII enzyme (NEB) were added,\
    \ and the chromatin was digested overnight at 37\xB0C with rotation. In the morning\
    \ 200 more units of DpnII were added and the cells were incubated for additional\
    \ 2 hours. DpnII was inactivated by incubation at 65\xB0C for 20 minutes. 20 \u03BC\
    l was taken as a digestion control. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at\
    \ 3,000g for 5 minutes, resuspended in 100 \u03BCl of 1\xD7 T4 DNA ligase buffer\
    \ (Thermo Scientific) and pelleted again. The pellet was resuspended in 500 \u03BC\
    l of 1\xD7 T4 DNA ligase buffer, and 50 U T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Scientific) were\
    \ added. The sample was mixed by inversion and incubated with rotation for 4 hours\
    \ at 16\xB0C and then for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then the nuclei were\
    \ pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 120 \u03BC\
    l of sterile PBS. 20 \u03BCl were taken as a ligation control. The rest of the\
    \ sample was stained with Hoechst, single G1 nuclei were sorted using excitation\
    \ wavelength 375 nm and forward and side scatter by FACS (FACSAriaIII machine,\
    \ BD Biosciences) into wells of 12 PCR strips containing 3 \u03BCl sample buffer\
    \ from illustra GenomiPhi v2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare), then they\
    \ were covered by 5 \u03BCl of mineral oil, incubated at 65\xB0C overnight and\
    \ amplified according to a protocol from Kumar et al, 2008. The amplification\
    \ was considered positive if the sample contained \u22651\_\u03BCg DNA, and these\
    \ samples were submitted for library preparation and sequencing\nThe library preparation\
    \ was done by the VBCF NGS unit (vbcf.ac.at) following the standard DNA sample\
    \  preparation protocol for Solexa platforms (NEB reagents)."
  Growth-Protocol: "K562 (a gift from Alexander Stark lab) cells were cultured in\
    \ RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine and Pen/Strep (100\
    \ U/ml and 100 \u03BCg/ml)."

Data-Processing: 'Base calling was performed by VBCF NGS unit

  Mapping: iterative mapping (see Imakaev et al, 2012) using bowtie2 with increased
  stringency parameters: --score-min -L 0.6,0.2--very-  sensitive

  Read filtering: if two reads map to the same strands, and each side of the read
  is within 500 bp of any side of the other read, we retained only one copy of the
  read.

  Additional filtering: we separated the genome into 500 bp bins. If any two bins
  were interacting more than once, only one interaction was counted. Since each region
  is only present in the single cell up to 4 times (in oocytes), we eliminated all
  500 bp bins that form more than 8 unique interactions with other bins.

  Filtered reads were then binned at different resolutions (we provide files at 200Kb
  resolution) using read start as a read position. No normalization was applied to
  the data.
