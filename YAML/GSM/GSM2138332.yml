Accession: GSM2138332
Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - ES cell
  - male
  Extract-Protocol: 'Long-range contacts were generated and ChIP was performed.

    Libraries were prepared using the Tn5 transposase.

    Nextera'
  Growth-Protocol: mES cells were grown on gelatin plates with serum and LIF. GM cells
    were grown in RPMI-1640 with serum.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Mus musculus
  Source: v6.5 embryonic stem cell
  Treatment-Protocol: Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes,
    then quenched with 0.125M glycine for 5 minutes.
  position: '1'
Channel-Count: '1'

  ref: contrib1
Data-Processing: 'Sequencing reads were aligned and paired, filtered for long-range
  contacts, and removed of duplicates using the HiC-Pro pipeline (PMID: 26619908).

  Processed reads were then inputted into the Juicebox pipeline (PMID: 27467250) to
  allow for visualization of the interaction matrix.

  Genome_build: hg19,mm9

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: *allValidPairs.txt: Output from the HiC-Pro
  pipeline. Aligned, filtered, and unique long-range contacts to call loops with.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: *hic: Output from the Juicebox pipeline.
  This file allows for visualization of the interaction matrix.'
