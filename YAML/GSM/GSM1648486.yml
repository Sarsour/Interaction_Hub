  Extract-Protocol: "ChIP-seq:Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldeyde for 10 min,\
    \ then nuclei were isolated and lysed. Chromatin was sheared by sonication to\
    \ a size of ~200-400 bp. Cleared lysates were precleared for 1 hour, then 10%\
    \ saved as input, and lysates were incubated with Dynabeads Protein G pre-bound\
    \ with the antibody of choice. After stringent washes, ChIP DNA was eluted from\
    \ beads, and together with input chromtain was reverse-crosslinked with proteinase\
    \ K. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.\
    \ Hi-C: Hi-C experiments were conducted using HindIII according to the method\
    \ described in Lieberman-Aiden, E. et al. Comprehensive mapping of long-range\
    \ interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome. Science 326, 289-93\
    \ (2009). RNA-seq: Xi-TgGFP TTFs (68-5-11) with the stable knock down of candidates\
    \ were treated with 5\u2019-azacytidine and etoposide at 0.3 \uF06DM each for\
    \ 3 days. Strand specific RNA-seq, the library preparation, deep sequencing, and\
    \ data analysis was followed as described in J. T. Kung et al., Locus-specific\
    \ targeting to the X chromosome revealed by the RNA interactome of CTCF. Molecular\
    \ cell 57, 361-375 (2015). All libraries were sequenced with Illumina Hiseq 2000\
    \ or 2500 using 50 cycles to obtain paired end reads.\nChIP-seq: Libraries were\
    \ constructed using the NEBNext ChIP-seq Library Preparation Kit with no modifications\
    \ to the protocol. We used 16 cycles during the PCR step. Hi-C:  Sequencing libraries\
    \ were constructed according to the method described in Lieberman-Aiden, E. et\
    \ al. Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles\
    \ of the human genome. Science 326, 289-93 (2009). RNA-seq: Total RNA was harvested\
    \ using trizol extraction, and ribosomal RNA was removed using RiboMinus. Strand-specific\
    \ libraries were generated by performing reverse transcription with Superscript\
    \ III, followed by second-strand synthesis using the NEBNext second-strand synthesis\
    \ module supplemented with dUTP, and then libraries were generated using the NEBNext\
    \ ChIP-seq Library Preparation Kit."

Data-Processing: 'ChIP-seq: Reads were aligned separately to the mus/129 and cas genomes
  using novoalign with default parameters for paired-end alignment, the coordinates
  of these alignments were then converted to mm9 coordinates with custom scripts.
  Following alignment, coverage files were generated for the composite set of reads
  (comp), as well as allelic reads that aligned better to mus (mus) or cas (cas) using
  custom perl scripts, SAMtools and bedtools to extract and sort allelic reads, remove
  duplicates and generate coverage files. The coverage files presented in the paper
  and in this archive are fpm normalized. Peaks were called using macs2 with default
  settings. Hi-C: The individual ends of the read-pairs were aligned to the mus and
  cas reference genomes separately using novoalign with default parameters for single-end
  alignments, and the quality score of the alignment was used to determine whether
  each end could be assigned to either the mus or the cas haplotype. The single-end
  alignments were merged into a HiCsummary file using custom scripts to determine
  whether a given read-pair could be assigned to the mus or cas haplotype and to pair
  up the two ends of the read-pair. RNA-seq: To determine the allelic origin of each
  sequencing read from the hybrid cells, reads were first depleted of adaptors dimers
  and PCR duplicates, followed by the alignment to custom mus/129 and cas genomes
  to separate mus and cas reads. Once completed, reads were then mapped back to reference
  mm9 genome using Tophat v2.0.10 (-g 1 --no-coverage-search --read-edit-dist 3 --read-mismatches
  3 --read-gap-length 3 --b2-very-sensitive --mate-inner-dist 50 --mate-std-dev 50
  --library-type fr-firststrand). Following alignment, gene expression levels within
  each library were quantified using Homer v4.7 (rna mm9 -count genes -strand + -noadj
  -condenseGenes) and the normalized differential expression analyses across samples
  were performed by using EdgeR.

  Genome_build: mm9

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: ChIP-seq: bigWig (bw) files for all reads
  (.comp), regardless of whether they are allele-specific or not, cas-specific (.cas)
  and mus-specific (.mus). All bigWig files are fpm-normalized, but not input normalized
  or smoothed. Hi-C: data is present in a Hi-C summary file, where each line corresponds
  to the coordinates of the the two end-pairs in the alignment. RNA-seq: aligned reads
  used for analysis are present in .bed files. Reads aligning to the + strand of the
  genome are in the "+" files and reads aligning to the - strand are in the - files.
  As for the ChIP-seq, reads are broken down into comp, cas and mus sets. Supplementary
  files included in this series consist of an excel file containing .fpkm values and
  the results of the differential expression analysis using edgeR for all RNA-seq
  experiments.'
