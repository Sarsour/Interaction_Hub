  Characteristics: MCF7
  Extract-Protocol: Hi-C was sequenced using PE100 reads; RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were
    sequenced using SE100 reads by using a HiSeq 2000 instrument
  Growth-Protocol: "The MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM\
    \ supplemental with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. For\
    \ shRNA-mediated knockdown of Runx1 expression, MCF7 cells were plated in six-well\
    \ plates (1x105\_cells per well) and infected 24 h later with lentivirus expressing\
    \ shRunx1 or nonspecific shRNA (Thermo Scientific).  Briefly, cells were treated\
    \ with 0.5 ml of lentivirus and 1.5 ml complete fresh DMEM high glucose per well\
    \ with a final concentration of 4 \u03BCg/ml polybrene. Plates were centrifuged\
    \ upon addition of the virus at 1460 \xD7\_g\_at 37 C for 30 min. Infection efficiency\
    \ was monitored by GFP co-expression at 2 days after infection. Cells were selected\
    \ with 2 \u03BCg/ml puromycin for at least two additional days. After removal\
    \ of the floating cells, the remaining attached cells were passed and analyzed."

Data-Processing: "RNA-seq: For  RNA-Seq analysis, first, the adapter sequences were\
  \ removed from the RNA-seq reads. \_Ribosomal RNA reads were then filtered out using\
  \ Bowtie (Song et al. 2014). \_After these filtration and adapter removal steps,\
  \ the reads were aligned to a transciptome and quantified using RSEM v1.2.7 (Li\
  \ and Dewey 2011). Differential gene expression was calculated by using the Deseq2\
  \ package in R 3.1.0 by using the mean value of gene-wise dispersion estimates (Love\
  \ et al. 2014).\nChIP-seq: ~1x107 parental MCF-7 cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde\
  \ at room temperature for 10 minutes.  Then, the cells were lysed using lysis buffer\
  \ A (50mM HEPES, 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA pH=8, 10% Glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton\
  \ X-100), and the residual cytoplasmic protein was removed using lysis buffer B\
  \ (10mM Tris-HCl pH=8, 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA).  The nuclear fraction was\
  \ released using lysis buffer C (10mM Tris-Hcl pH=8, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA,\
  \ 0.1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine).  The chromatin was then sheared\
  \ by using a Covaris S2 instrument with 10% duty cycle, 5 intensity, 200 cycles\
  \ per burst, frequency sweeping mode, 60 second process time and for 4 cycles. The\
  \ pull-down was performed by using the RUNX1 antibody (Cell Signaling #4334).  Samples\
  \ were washed three times with RIPA buffer (Tris-HCl pH=8, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA,\
  \ 1% NP-40, 0.25% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and were eluted.  The pull-down\
  \ and input control sequencing libraries were generated by using the NEXTflex Rapid\
  \ DNA Sequencing Kit (Bioo Scientific #5144-02) and were sequenced by using SE100\
  \ reads with a HiSeq 2000 instrument.\ndata processing step: The Hi-C data were\
  \ mapped with Bowtie and  binned at 6.5Mb, 1Mb, 250kb, 100kb and 40kb non-overlapping\
  \ genomic intervals.  Iterative mapping and correction of Hi-C data were performed\
  \ as previously described (Imakaev et al. 2012).  Biological replicates showed high\
  \ reproducibility (Pearson's correlation coefficient > 0.9 for 1Mb resolution data).\
  \  Similarly, the first eigenvector comparison of the replicates showed high reproducibility.\
  \  For the downstream analyses, sequences obtained from both biological replicates\
  \ were pooled and ICE-corrected to serve as a combined dataset.\nCompartment analysis:\
  \ First, the z-scores of the interaction matrices at 250kb resolution were generated\
  \ as described previously (Lieberman, 2009).  Then, Pearson Correlation on the Z-score\
  \ matrices was calculated.  By performing principal component analysis (Lieberman-Aiden\
  \ et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2012), the first eigenvector typically represents the\
  \ compartment profile(Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009), where the positive and negative\
  \ 1st eigenvalues represent different compartments.   Gene density for each compartment\
  \ was calculated to call the \u201CA\u201D and \u201CB\u201D compartmentalization.\n\
  TAD Calling : TAD calling was performed as calculating the \u201Cinsulation\u201D\
  \ score of each bin using the 40kb resolution combined Hi-C data (as previously\
  \ described.  The mean of the interactions across each bin were calculated.  By\
  \ sliding a 1Mb x 1Mb (25bins x 25bins) square along the diagonal of the interaction\
  \ matrix for every chromosome, we obtained the \u201Cinsulation score\u201D of the\
  \ interaction matrix.  Valleys in the insulation score indicated the depletion of\
  \ Hi-C interactions occurring across a bin.  These 40kb valleys represent the TAD\
  \ boundaries.  Based on the variation of boundaries between replicates, we chose\
  \ to add a total of 160kb (80kb to each side) to the boundary to account for replicate\
  \ variation.  The final boundaries span a 200kb region. All boundaries with a boundary\
  \ strength < 0.15 were excluded as they were considered weak and non-reproducible.\
  \  The insulation plots for the biological replicates showed high reproducibility,\
  \ suggesting the robustness of the method.  Similarly, the overlap of detected boundaries\
  \ also showed high reproducibility between the biological replicates.  Therefore,\
  \ we used the combined Hi-C replicates for the TAD analyses.\nZ-Score Calculation:\
  \ We modeled the overall Hi-C decay with distance using a modified LOWESS method\
  \ (alpha = 1%, IQR filter), as described previously (Sanyal et al. 2012).  LOWESS\
  \ calculates the weighted-average and weighted-standard deviation for every genomic\
  \ distance and therefore normalizes for genomic distance signal bias.\nGenome_build:\
