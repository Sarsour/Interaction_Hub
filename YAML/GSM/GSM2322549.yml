  Extract-Protocol: 'For newly generated Hi-C datasets presented in this study, Hi-C
    was performed as previously described (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009) with minor
    modifications pertaining to the handling of flash-frozen human tissue as previously
    described (Leung et al., 2015). Flash frozen human tissues were first pulverized
    using mortar as pestle, and then crosslinked for 25min using 1% formaldehyde,
    quenched with Glycine, washed with PBS and then input into the remaining Hi-C
    protocol or flash frozen for future analysis. For each experiment, ~65mg of tissue
    was used for subsequent Hi-C library preparation, but varied from tissue to tissue
    depending on cellular density of each tissue. Using ~65mg of tissue, samples were
    lysed and dounced to obtain single nuclei suspensions. Chromatin was then solubilized
    with SDS, and then quenched with TritonX-100. Chromatin was digested overnight
    with HindIII. Digested ends were filled-in dNTPs, except a biotinylated dCTP was
    used to label digested ends. Nuclei were then lysed using SDS, and chromatin complexes
    were diluted. Ligation was performed in large volumes to favor intra-molecular
    ligation events. Crosslinks were reversed by overnight incubation with Proteinase
    K and high temperatures. DNA was then purified using two rounds of Pheno-Chloroform
    purification, followed by ethanol precipitation. Biotinylated nucleotides on unligated
    ends were removed by a T4 DNA polyermase reaction, and purified using ethanol
    precipitation. DNA was then quantified using Qubit Fluorometer, and <=5ug of DNA
    was used for subsequent library preparation.

    Libraries were constructed using a modifed Illumina TruSeq library preparation
    method specific to the preparation of Hi-C libraries for Illumina sequencing,
    as previously described (Lieberman-Aiden et al, 2009). First Hi-C ligation products
    were sheared to ~400bp fragment size. Sheard ends were repaired using a combination
    of T4 PNK, T4 DNA polymerase, and Klenow. The reaction was purified using Qiagen
    MinElute columns. DNA molecules were then dA-tailed using Klenow(exo-) and then
    size selected from 200-600bp using agaorse gel and purified. Biotin-labeled DNA
    species were then enriched using streptavidin-coated beads and Illumina TruSeq
    adapters were ligated using T4 DNA ligase while DNA is bound to the streptavidin
    beads. Beads were then washed, and PCR amplified to obtain enough material for
    Illumina sequencing.'

Data-Processing: 'Library strategy: HiC-Seq

  Each Hi-C read end was mapped indepenedently using BWA -mem and default parameters.
  BWA version 0.7.8 was used.

  Read ends with >1 alighment were filtered and only 5'' alignments were kept using
  in-house Python script.

  SAM files were converted to BAM files and sorted using Samtools Version 0.1.18

  PCR duplicates were removed using PicardTools Version 1.49

  Reads aligning >500bp from Hi-C restriction enzyme cutsites were removed and reads
  <15kb insert size were removed using in-house scripts.

  Raw contact matrices were constructed using in-house scripts, or normalization was
  applied using HiCNorm, VC, or ICE, where noted.

  FIREs were identified by first applying HiCNormCis on the raw contact marix, as
  described in this manuscript.

  TAD boundaires were identified by applying the insulation square method on the HiCNorm
  matrices, as previously described (Crane et al., 2015)

  A/B compartments were identified as previously described (Lieberman-Aiden et al.,
  2009)

  Statistically significant Hi-C contacts were identified using Fit-Hi-C, as previously
  described (Ay et al., 2014)

  Genome_build: Human data is in hg19, mouse data is in mm9.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Hi-C matrices are provided at 40kb bin resolution
  in NxN format for each chromosome for either raw contact maps, or Hi-C matrices
  normalized with HiCNorm, or HiCNorm followed by quantile normalization using samples
  from the same published or unpublished source. Even if a dataset was not specifically
  used in this study, a contact matrix was generated for each sample, for each study.
  For example, all samples from Zuin et al, 2014 are quantile normalized together.  FIRE
  and TAD boundary annotations are provided as a unique BED file for each sample.
  Compartment A/B annotations are provided as a unique bigwig file for each sample.
  Fit-Hi-C output is provided in a 7-column format, corresponding to position 1, position
  2, observed count, expected count, O/E, p-value, and q-value. Only the upper-triangle
  matrix entries (where i<=j)  are provided, and only pairwise contacts within 2Mb
  genomic distance are provided.'
