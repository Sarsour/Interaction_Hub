  Growth-Protocol: "The transformed mouse cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified\
    \ eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin\
    \ supplemented with puromycin. Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (FY1199 and DD1618\
    \ - European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC)) were grown in RPMI-1640 medium\
    \ with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Tumors were\
    \ received from Prof. V. Peter Collins (Department of Pathology, Addenbrooke\u2019\
    s Hospital, Cambridge, UK), with accompanying full ethical approval, as fresh\
    \ frozen pieces consisting of between 75% and 90% tumor content, as determined\
    \ by the pathologist. Approximately 160 mg of frozen tumor was finely chopped\
    \ before being fixed and taken through the Hi-C protocol."
