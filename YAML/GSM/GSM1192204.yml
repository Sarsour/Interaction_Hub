Accession: GSM1192204
Channel:
  Characteristics:
  - neural stem cells
  - deleted--mutant
  Extract-Protocol: 'Cells were treated with accutase and immediately fixed with 1%
    formaldehyde before proceeding with Hi-C protocol.The PE library preparations
    for the HiC were also done according to illuminas PE kit procedure.

    Ligated material was sonicated, enriched for biotinylated ligation junctions and
    PE sequencing adapters were added according to Illumina standard protocols'
  Growth-Protocol: Cells were grown in serum-free media containing EGF+FGF (for NSCs)
    or BMP+FGF (for ASTs) and Laminin
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Mus musculus
  Source: neural stem cells
  Treatment-Protocol: To delete Rad21, cells were grown in OHT for 48hr (for NSCs)
    or AdCre for 96hr (for ASTs)
