    Nextera'
  Growth-Protocol: mES cells were grown on gelatin plates with serum and LIF.
  Molecule: genomic DNA

Data-Processing: 'Sequencing reads were aligned and paired, filtered for long-range
  contacts, and removed of duplicates using the HiC-Pro pipeline (PMID: 26619908).

  Processed reads were then inputted into the Juicebox pipeline (PMID: 27467250) to
  allow for visualization of the interaction matrix.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: *allValidPairs.txt: Output from the HiC-Pro
  pipeline. Aligned, filtered, and unique long-range contacts to call loops with.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: *hic: Output from the Juicebox pipeline.
  This file allows for visualization of the interaction matrix.'
