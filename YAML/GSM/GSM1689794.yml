  Extract-Protocol: 'DNase Hi-C or in situ DNase Hi-C:  Cells are cross-linked with
    formaldehyde; chromatin is then randomly fragmented by DNase I. The resulting
    chromatin fragments are end-repaired and dA-tailed, then marked with a biotinylated
    internal adaptor; and proximity ligation is carried out inside individual nuclei
    to favor ligation events between the cross-linked DNA fragments. The resulting
    DNA sample contains ligation products consisting of chimeric DNA fragments that
    were originally in close spatial proximity in the nucleus, marked with biotin
    at the junction. A whole-genome chromatin interaction library is created by shearing
    the DNA and selecting the biotin-containing fragments with streptavidin magnetic
    beads. After linear library amplification, a DNase Hi-C library is generated and
    can be sequenced to identify whole-genome chromatin contacts.'

Data-Processing: 'First, we performed an exhaustive search and cleaning of the Illumina
  primer and adaptor sequences in the full-length reads and extracted the remaining
  read fragments of various lengths from 25-80 bp.

  A pseudo-spretus genome was assembled by replacing available SNPs between C57BL/6J
  and M. spretus (Sanger) into the BL6 reference genome.

  We then mapped each end of these cleaned paired-end reads separately to the C57BL/6J
  genome (mm9 assembly) and the pseudo-spretus genome using BWA/v0.5.9. We only retained
  the reads that mapped uniquely, allowing at most 3 mismatches and requiring mapping
  quality MAPQ >= 30. Only high-quality uniquely-mapped reads were used for assignment
  to each haploid genome based on available SNPs.

  To eliminate the bias due to the PCR duplication step, we removed redundant paired-end
  reads. We define two reads as redundant if both ends of the reads are mapped to
  identical locations in the genome.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: txt files, containing uniquely mapped and
  non-redundent read pairs. The files are tab-delimited. The columns are #1 read identifier,
  #2 strand of the 1st end, #3 mapped chr of the 1st end, #4 mapped coordinate of
  the 1st end, #5 allele of 1st read (ref: BL6; alt: spretus; both-ref; allele-uncertain
  reads), #6 sequence of 1st end, #7 strand of the 2nd end, #8 mapped chr of the 2nd
  end, #9 mapped coordinate of the 2nd end, #10 allele of 2nd read (ref: BL6; alt:
  spretus; both-ref; allele-uncertain reads), #11 sequence of 2nd end.'
