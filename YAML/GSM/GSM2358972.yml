  Extract-Protocol: "Cross-linked chromatin was released by detergent lysis and Dounce\
    \ homogenization.  Cross-linked proteins were then biotinylated at cysteine residues\
    \ and the DNA digested with DpnII.  Digested chromatin was bound to streptavidin\
    \ beads, thoroughly washed to remove uncross-linked DNA, DNA ends filled in with\
    \ biotin-14-dATP, and free DNA ends ligated together.  DNA-protein cross-links\
    \ were reversed, DNA purified, and biotinylated nucleotides marking unligated\
    \ ends removed.\nDNA sheared to a size of approximately 500 bp.  DNA was end-repaired\
    \ and adaptor-ligated by following \u201CNEBNext End Prep\u201D and \u201CAdaptor\
    \ Ligation\u201D in the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New\
    \ England Biolabs).  The biotinylated DNA was pulled down with streptavidin beads\
    \ and PCR amplified by following \"PCR Amplification\" in the NEBNext Ultra II\
    \ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs)."
  Growth-Protocol: "Kc167 cells were obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource\
    \ Center (Bloomington, IN).  Cells were grown in CCM3 media (HyClone) at 25\xB0\
    \ C following Drosophila Genomics Resource Center protocols."
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Drosophila melanogaster
  Source: Kc167 cultured cells
  Treatment-Protocol: 1 billion Kc167 cells at a density of 4-6 x 10^6 cells/mL were
    washed with 20 mL CMM3 media and then cross-linked with 1% EM-grade paraformaldehyde.

Data-Processing: 'Reads were mapped to dm3/BDGP Release 5 of the Drosophila melanogaster
  genome using BWA-MEM.

  Reads were assigned to DpnII restriction fragments, duplicates removed, reads with
  a MAPQ < 30 removed, and intra-fragment reads removed.

  Genome was then divided into equally spaced bins.

  To account for the uncertainty in the location of the position of the cross-link
  within each restriction fragment,the read position was radnomized within the restriction
  fragment each read mapped to and the resulting contact was assigned to its respective
  genomic bin.

  Hi-C contact maps were normalized by matrix balancing using the KR normalization
  algorithm (Durand et al., 2016; Knight and Ruiz, 2012; Rao et al., 2014).

  Biological replicates combined after filtering, intrafragment read positions randomized
  as described above, and the combined contact map KR normalized.  All subsequent
  analysis was performed on the combined, KR normalized contact map.

  TADs were identified using the previously described Arrowhead algorithm (Durand
  et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2014), with an additional post-processing step:  TADs
  were identified at 5 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, and 500 bp resolution using the Arrowhead algorithm,
  merged into a single list sorted by decreasing corner score, and conflicts, defined
  as the boundary of one TAD being located within another TAD, resolved by using the
  greater corner score of any conflicting TADs.

  Loops were annotated by visual identification of focal peaks of contact enrichment
  using Juicebox (Durand et al., 2016).

  All of the above steps were performed using the previously described Juicer pipeline
  (Durand et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2014) and Juicebox visualization interface (Durand
  et al., 2016).
