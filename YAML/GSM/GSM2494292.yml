  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C was performed essentially as previously described (Rao et
    al., 2014). Briefly, for each template roughly 10 million cells were crosslinked
    using 2% formaldehyde. In nucleus restriction was performed using MboI. Restriction
    overhangs were filled in with biotinylated nucleotides followed by blunt-end ligation.
    A streptavidin pull-down was performed to enrich for ligated sequences.

    Pulled-down DNA was end-repaired and an A-overhang was added. Sequencing adapters
    were ligated to the DNA samples to create sequencing libraries.'
  Growth-Protocol: HAP1 cells (Carette et al., 2011) were cultured in IMDM (Invitrogen)
    supplemented with 10% FCS (Clontech), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen)
    and 1% Ultraglutamin (Lonza).

  Treatment-Protocol: "CRISPRs targeting WAPL (5\u2019-CACCGCGTTCCATAGTATCCTGTA-3\u2019\
    ) and SCC4 (5\u2019-CACCGTACGGGCCTCGATGCGCTG-3\u2019) were cloned into px330 (Addgene\
    \ plasmid #42230). \u2206WAPL and \u2206SCC4 HAP1 clones were generated by insertion\
    \ of a Blasticidine or Puromycin cassette respectively, as previously described\
    \ (Blomen et al., 2015). \u2206WAPL/\u2206SCC4 cells were generated by knocking\
    \ out SCC4 in \u2206WAPL cells."
