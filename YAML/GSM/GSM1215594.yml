Channel:
  Characteristics: 36 hpi; late schizont stage
  Extract-Protocol: "P. falciparum cultures were crosslinked for 25 minutes at 37C\
    \ in 1.25% formaldehyde. The reaction was quenched for 15 min at 37C, followed\
    \ by extensive washes to remove cellular debris. We then applied an adapted Hi-C\
    \ method referred to as tethered conformation capture. Briefly, proteins were\
    \ first biotinylated and the DNA was digested using the restriction enzyme MboI.\
    \ Fragments were captured on streptavidin-coated beads, ligated under dilute conditions\
    \ and subsequently sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, generating\
    \ 50 bp paired-end reads.\nLibraries were generated using the NEBNext ChIP-Seq\
    \ Library Preparation kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\
    \ with the following modifications for the high AT-content of the P. falciparum\
    \ genome: libraries were amplified for a total of 11 PCR cycles (3 cycles of [15s\
    \ at 98\xB0C, 30s at 55\xB0C, 30s at 62\xB0C] followed by 8 cycles of [15s at\
    \ 98\xB0C, 30s at 63\xB0C, 30s at 72\xB0C])."
  Growth-Protocol: P. falciparum strain 3D7 was maintained in human O+ erythrocytes
    in 5% haematocrit according to a previously described protocol (Trager et al.,
    Science 1976).
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Plasmodium falciparum 3D7
  Source: Erythrocytic cycle
  Treatment-Protocol: Cultures were synchronized twice at ring stage with 5% D-sorbitol
    treatments performed eight hours apart. Parasites were harvested 48 hours after
    the first sorbitol treatment (0h; ring stage), and then 18 hours (early trophozoite
    stage) and 36 hours (late schizont stage) thereafter. The developmental stage
    of the parasites was verified by microscopy using Giemsa-stained blood smears
    prior to harvesting.

Data-Processing: 'All raw paired-end reads were trimmed to 40 bp and each end was
  mapped separately to whole human genome (hg19) using BWA v0.5.9 with default parameters
  allowing an edit distance of at most 3 in order to filter the human DNA contamination
  in samples. All pairs with at least one of the ends mapped to the human genome (without
  checking quality or uniqueness) were eliminated from further consideration. Remaining
  paired-end reads were used for further analysis of Plasmodium genome architecture
  (trimmedAndFiltered files).

  Each end of the paired-end reads in trimmedAndFiltered fastq files was mapped separately
  to Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 (PlasmoDB v9.0) genome using BWA v0.5.9 with default
  parameters. The alignment results were post-processed further to extract the reads
  that mapped (i) uniquely to one location in the reference genome, (ii) with an alignment
  quality score of at least 30 (which corresponds to a 1 in 1000 chance that the mapping
  is incorrect), and (iii) with an edit distance of at most 2. The paired-end reads
  with both ends mapping to the Plasmodium genome were kept for further analysis.
  Potential PCR duplicates (i.e., pairs of read-pairs with identical genomic coordinates)
  were identified and only one copy of each such group of reads were retained.

  Each paired-end read was assigned to a pair of restriction enzyme fragments (restriction
  enzyme used is MboI with cut site |GATC) that are listed by their start coordinates
  in MboI-cutSites.txt file. The mapping coordinates of the reads were used to identify
  the nearest MboI restriction site to do the assignment of read pairs to restriction
  fragment pairs. At this native resolution of one restriction fragment (1RE) the
  number of times each fragment pair is linked were calculated as the number of observed
  paired-end reads that link the two fragments. These numbers were listed in rawContactCounts-1RE
  files for each of the three crosslinked as well as the not crosslinked control library.

  For 3D modeling and other downstream analysis the Plasmodium genome was partitioned
  into non-overlapping 10 kb windows and each restriction fragment was assigned to
  the 10 kb window that covers the majority of the bases in that fragment. For each
  pair of such 10 kb windows, the contact count was calculated as the total number
  of times a pair of restriction fragments, one from each 10 kb window, were linked
  by a paired-end read. These numbers were listed in rawContactCounts-10kb files for
  each of the three crosslinked as well as the not crosslinked control library.

  The 10 kb aggregated raw contact count matrices were normalized in two steps. First,
  all 10 kb windows were ranked by their percentage of intrachromosomal interactions
  with zero counts, and the top 2% of this list were filtered out from further analysis
  removing regions of low mappability. Second, an iterative correction and eigenvector
  decomposition (ICE) method (Imakaev et al, Nature Methods 2012) was applied which
  attempts to eliminate systematic biases in Hi-C data. This method generates normalized
  contact counts from each raw contact count which are listed for as normalizedContactCounts-10kb
  files for the three crosslinked libraries. Control library was not subjected to
  normalization.
