  Extract-Protocol: 'A total of 500 ml of cells (OD at 600nm ~ 0.5) was fixed in 3%
    formaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min at 26 C, and quenched with glycine for 5 min at
    26 C.  Cells were poured into liquid nitrogen using 1x NEB2, disrupted by nitrogen
    grinding.  Cell lysate was treated with 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 65 C, and then
    quenched with 1% TritonX-100.  Cell lysate was digested overnight with 100 U HindIII
    at 37 C.  The 5'' overhang from the HindIII digestion was filled in using Klenow
    fragment in presence of biotin-14-dCTP and dATP, dGTP, and dTTP at 37 C for 45
    min.  The reaction was terminated with 1.5% SDS.  The DNA fragments were ligated
    by T4 DNA ligase in diluted conditions that favor the ligation between cross-linked
    DNA fragments in 16 C for 8 hours (Hi-C DNA).

    The HiC-DNA was reverse cross-linked at 65 C overnight in the presence of proteinase
    K and purified by phenol/chrolorom extraction.  Purified Hi-C DNA was treated
    with 1 mg/ml Rnase A for 30 min at 37 C.  Un-ligated biotin lablelled DNA was
    selectively removed by T4 DNA plymerase and reaction were purified by phenol/chloroform
    extraction.  Hi-C DNA was then sheared by ultrasonication (Covaris) in the size
    range of <500 bp.  The sheared Hi-C DNA was subjected to end-repair and 3'' end
    adenylation.  Hi-C DNA between 150 - 300 bp was selected with AMPure XP (Beckman-Coulter).  The
    biotin-labled Hi-C DNA was selectively captured by Dynabeads Myone Streptavidin
    C1 (Invitrogen) and used for Illumina PE adapter ligation.  Streptavidin beads
    containing bounds Hi-C DNA were used for the template for library amplification
    by PE-PCR primers (Illumina).'
  Growth-Protocol: The Cells were grown on YEA at optimal temperature (30 C).  Wherever
    temperature sensitive mutatnts were used, the cells were incubated at elevated
    temperatures (33 C) for 4 - 6 hours before library preparation.
  Molecule: genomic DNA
  Organism: Schizosaccharomyces pombe
  Source: G1 arrested cells in Cdc10 mutants
  Treatment-Protocol: The temperature was shifted in the temperature sensitive mutants.

Data-Processing: 'The pipeline for processing of each data-set was assembled around
  the library (see https://bitbucket.org/mirnylab).  Briefly, each read of the sample
  was treated separately for alignment purposes and the information was then put together
  to make the HiC contact maps.  The bowtie2 aligner was used to align each reads
  from each end.  Only uniquely mapping reads were considered for further analysis.

  The mapping is interative and starts with first 25 bases of each read, this length
  is extended by 5 bases till 75 bases to look for a unique mapping.

  The assembled fragments are then filtered at the restriction fragment level and
  all the reads that span more than 4 restrction sites are discarded.  All the double
  sided reads  are discarded.  All the reads right next to the restriction site (possible
  dangling ends) are discarded.  All the duplicates are discarded.  All the fragments
  with very high or very low counts are discarded (these are usually possible PCR
  artefacts).  Very large and very small fragments are discarded.  All the interactions
  separated by very few restriction fragments are also discarded.  These data is then
  binned at 10 kB resolution

  The bins with lowest 3% coverage are discarded (in addition to bins with zero counts).  Remove
  the diagonal and neighboring diagonal (i.e. interactions < 20kB).  Remove the standalone
  bins.  Do the iteractive correction.   Interpolate the singleton bins (singleton
  bins are the filtered out bins that are flanked by non-filtered out bins).  Normalize
  the sum = 1 along each row and column.

  For replicate samples, an average matrix was used.

  Genome_build: S. pombe Sept 2007 version from PomBase.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Each file contains a square matrix.  Each
  row and column has three parts, the

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: bin number, the number of a 10 kB bin.  Each
  bin number begins with number of

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: the chromosome on which that bin belongs.  Then
  there is name of the organism,

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: and finally the genomic coordinates of the
  regions represented by that bin.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Each cell in the matrix denotes score of
  interaction between the bins denotes by

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: the defining row and column.  The NA and
  NANs are the values that were discarded

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: during the process of generation of the
  interaction scores.'
