  Extract-Protocol: 'Hi-C experiments were performed using HindIII according to previous
    publications (Le et al, 2013, PMID: 24158908). ChIP-seq experiments were performed
    using anti-mCherry antibodies according to previous publications (Graham et al,
    2014 PMID 24829297).

    Standard library construction protocol was used for Illumina Hiseq2500 sequencing
    platform (Hi-C) or Illumina Miseq (ChIP-seq). Illumina Truseq indexes were used.'
  Growth-Protocol: 'Bacillus subtilis strains were derived from the prototrophic strain
    PY79 (Youngman et al 1983, PMID: 6300908). Cells were grown in defined rich medium
    (CH) (Harwood and Cutting 1990, Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus ) or
    minimal medium (S750) (Grossman and Losick, 1988, PMID:3132711) supplemented with
    1% sorbitol. Sporulation was induced by resuspension according to the method of
    Sterlini-Mandelstam (Harwood and Cutting 1990, Molecular Biological Methods for
    Bacillus). For Hi-C experiments during sporulation, strains contained a mutant
    of the SpoIIIE DNA translocase (spoIIIE36) that engages the chromosome after polar
    division but does not transport DNA (Wu and Errington, 1994, PMID: 8160014).'

Data-Processing: 'Reads from each end of a DNA fragment were represented in each of
  the two FASTQ files generated by Illumina paired-end sequencing.

  For Hi-C, we mapped reads in each FASTQ file back to the genome of Bacillus subtilis
  PY79 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_022898.1) independently by Bowtie version 2.1.0
  to preserve the order of reads. All the processing steps afterwards were performed
  using an in-house Perl scripts. For ChIP-seq, we mapped reads in each FASTQ file
  back to the genome of Bacillus subtilis PY79 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_022898.1)
  independently using CLC genomics workbench 8.0, and exported .csv file.

  For Hi-C, the two resulting SAM files were then merged together. Unaligned reads
  were discarded.

  For Hi-C, the Bacillus subtilis (PY79) genome was divided into restriction fragments
  (2398 HindIII fragments). Each aligned read was sorted into its corresponding restriction
  fragment. We inferred that a DNA fragment resulted from non-ligation or self-ligation
  if reads from both ends were from the same restriction fragment; these reads were
  discarded. Only DNA fragments for which the reads came from different restriction
  fragments were retained and used for construction of a Hi-C contact map.

  For Hi-C, the genome of Bacillus subtilis (PY79) was then divided into bins 10 kb
  and the remaining reads were allocated to their corresponding bin. We then counted
  the number of fragments having reads with in different bins. A raw Hi-C contact
  map is the matrix of read counts in which each entry, mij, indicates the number
  of fragments with ends mapping to bins i and j. The raw Hi-C contact map/matrix
  is biased due to the uneven distribution of restriction enzyme sites and, to a lesser
  extent, differences in GC content and the mappability of individual reads. We normalized
  raw contact maps using an iterative normalization procedure (Imakaev et al., 2012
  PMID: 22941365). Essentially, we converted the number of interactions, or read counts,
  into Hi-C scores by applying the following equation and iteratively repeating it
  for the resulting contact map after each cycle:  mij =mij * (total reads) / (total
  reads in bin i * total reads in bin j). The iterative procedure was repeated until
  the maximum relative error of the total number of Hi-C scores in a bin was less
  than 10-5. Resulting matrices were normalized so that Hi-C scores for each row and
  column sum to 1. Subsequent analysis and visualization was done using R scripts.

  ChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the genome of Bacillus subtilis PY79 (NCBI Reference
  Sequence: NC_022898.1) independently using CLC genomics workbench 8.0, and exported
  .csv file.

  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Files ending with .matrix.txt: tab-delimited
  text files of the iteratively-corrected Hi-C contact maps/matrices. Each column
  represents a 10kb bin (0-10K, 10-20k, 20-30k, etc) of the B. subtilis genome  and
  each row is a 10kb bin of the Bacillus subtilis PY79 genome (0-10K, 10-20k, 20-30k,
  etc). The cells contain the normalized Hi-C interaction score.   Files ending with
  .csv: comma-separated values files of ChIP-seq result, where the columns headers
  are: genome position, number of reads at each position.'
