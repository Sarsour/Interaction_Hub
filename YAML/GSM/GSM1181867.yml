Data-Processing: "fastq:  Illumina's HiSeq Control Software\nFor Hi-C read alignment,\
  \ we aligned Hi-C reads to the mm9 (mouse) or the hg18 (human) genome. In each case,\
  \ we masked any bases in the genome that were genotyped as SNPs in either Mus musculus\
  \ castaneus or S129/SvJae (for mouse) or GM12878 (for humans). These bases were\
  \ masked to \u201CN\u201D in order to reduce reference bias mapping artifacts. Hi-C\
  \ reads were aligned iteratively as single end reads using Novoalign. Specifically,\
  \ for iterative alignment, we first aligned the entire sequencing read to either\
  \ the mouse or human genome. Unmapped reads are then trimmed by 5 base pairs and\
  \ realigned. This process is repeated until the read successfully aligns to the\
  \ genome or until the trimmed read is less than 25 base pairs long.  After iterative\
  \ mapping was finished, read pairs were re-constructed from single reads using an\
  \ in house pipeline.  Unmapped reads were filtered out and PCR duplicate reads were\
  \ removed.  Final alignment files were then processed using the GATK pipeline, specifically\
  \ using Indel Realignment and Variant Recalibration\nHaplotypes were generated from\
  \ the final aligned bam file after merging the two biological replicats using the\
  \ HapCUT algorithm.  The details of HapCUT are described previously (Bansal and\
  \ Bafna, Bioinformatics 24, i153-159, 2008).\nGenome_build: mm9\nGenome_build: hg18\n\
  Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The castx129_variants.vcf and GM12878_depristoeal.vcf\
  \ are VCF format files of the variants used for input into the haplotyping algorithm.\
  \  Both of these files are derived from publicly available datasets. WIth regards\
  \ to the \"publicly available datasets\", the castx129_variants.vcf file is derived\
  \ from data downloaded from the ENA (ERP000042) and the SRA (SRX037820).  The GM12878_depristoeal.vcf\
  \ is downloaded from the 1000 genomes project.\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content:\
  \ The F123.haps and GM12878_seed.haps are modified bed format files.  In this files,\
  \ the first column is the chromosome, and the second column is the location of the\
  \ variant.  The third and fourth column are the phased variants in the \"A\" and\
  \ \"B\" haplotypes.  The choice of \"A\" and \"B\" is arbitrary, and it should be\
  \ noted that the \"A\" haplotype from one chromosome is not necessarily derived\
  \ from the same parent as the \"A\" haplotype from a different chromosome.\nSupplementary_files_format_and_content:\
  \ The GM12878_lcp.vcf file is a VCF format file from after local conditional phasing\
  \ of variants in the seed haplotype"
